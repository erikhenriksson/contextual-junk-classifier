{"text": "Barrett's esophagus is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and is defined as a change in the esophageal epithelium of any length that can be recognized at endoscopy and is confirmed to have intestinal metaplasia by biopsy. Esophageal ulcerations and stricture are rarely seen, and the major complications of this disease are epithelial dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Dysplasia is felt to represent the best currently available marker of increased cancer risk in these patients. However, there are many pitfalls in the histologic recognition of dysplasia, a particularly difficult problem in the face of active inflammation in patients with ongoing reflux disease. The recognition and grading of dysplasia is subject to significant interobserver variability, particularly at the lower end of the histologic spectrum (negative v indefinite for dysplasia v low-grade dysplasia). High-grade dysplasia and to a lesser degree low-grade dysplasia are markers of increased cancer risk, although their natural history are difficult to determine. Up to 40% of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia have an adenocarcinoma in their esophagectomy specimen. Despite this observation, there is still debate as to whether esophagectomy or close endoscopic surveillance with biopsy is the most appropriate and cost-effective way to manage these patients. The search for more objective surrogate biomarkers that recognize patients who are truly at risk of progressing along the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence is underway. However, no biomarker has yet proven to be superior to the histologic recognition of dysplasia in identifying these high-risk patients.", "label": "clean"}

As I posted before, I would prefer the Public Health head of a large population state, or an undersecretary or regional director from a recent past administration. Still, Sebelius is a huge improvement on a Daschle or a Gregg -she's actually managed a fairly large bureacracy, and has decent intellectual credentials (JD -harvard, MPA U Kansas, I beleive). Also, in an original star trek kind of symbolism, I like the idea aesthetically of the HHS director coming from something closer to the health and human services sciences. It's not like (to my knowledge) Sebelius was even a health and/or human services policy specialist prior to becoming a governor. Still, I think she meets the threshhold competency minimum -although she's not close to the archetype of the perfect nominee for the job. That's why I suspect subordinated potential rivals is putting the thumb heavily on the Obama scale for her.", "label": "clean"}

On April 29, 1992 a jury acquitted four Los Angeles Police Department officers accused in the videotaped beating of African-American motorist Rodney King. The outrage that followed is now called the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. I was born in Pasadena, California and my youth was spent in and around the suburbs of Los Angeles. Los Angeles was my stomping grounds and I loved the city. At the time of the Rodney King trials I had been working weekly for the Los Angeles Times and that trial was definitely heating things up. The weekend after the acquittal the city was ready to blow and so many of us were outraged with the acquittal. I took off that weekend to San Francisco right when it blew. On Monday morning I checked my answering machine and I had gotten a call from Nancy Duckworth explaining that the Los Angeles Times Magazine was hiring 9 LA artists to depict their personal feelings and art in response to the verdict and the riots and that the artist, could do anything, no sketches just make sure that the art gets in by Thursday. I called Nancy, accepted the assignment and didn't tell her that I was in San Francisco. Next step, find all of the art supplies needed to create a mobile printmaking studio. I bought some plexiglass, a roller , speedball inks, paint thinner, pencils and I was able to find my favorite hand made Japanese paper in San Francisco. I worked that night on a card table under a single light bulb in my sister in laws garage with a bunch of makeshift supplies and I created this piece. Sent it out Fed-Ex the next day and the whole process was a complete artist rush to create. The other 8 artists commissioned were: Marty Gunsaullus, Todd Gray, Christian Clayton, Sherry Etheridge, Joel Nakamura, Greg Clarke, Scott Morgan and Greg Spalenka. Art Direction was Nancy Duckworth and Steven E. Banks.", "label": "clean"}

It is not clear that he has cleanup experience, having worked in the military side of DOE for many years, and in the actual military before that. Time will tell what kind of leader he will be. Hopefully he will take the time to learn about safety culture at Hanford from multiple perspectives, and do what it takes to make Hanford a place where cleanup decisions reflect input from a wide range of voices and perspectives.", "label": "clean"}

Our holdings are cheap relative to underlying equity values – as cheap as in the beginning of 2012. The Fund is highly focused on 5 companies representing nearly 80% of its net assets, with the knowledge that it is better to own more of your best ideas than your 10th best. Today, cash and equivalents stand at $1.49 billion, about 19.7% of the Fund. Given current liquidity and the potential for performance dilution to shareholders, the Fund has determined to suspend the sale of shares to new investors after the last day of this February. The Fund will remain available for purchase to existing shareholders, may make exceptions to this suspension, and reserves the right to recommence sales to new investors in the future.", "label": "clean"}

I was so relieved to learn that she was an atheist as well. She was an emotional atheist (no knowledge of any of the arguments for/against the gods – just a basic lack of belief in gods) for a long time. She ultimately crossed the bridge into logical atheism (knowledge of the arguments and ability to refute religionists) as she walked around the world without religious blindfolds and began to understand how things really worked. She was free of her religious bondage and able to truly explore and appreciate the world for what it was.", "label": "clean"}

Besides these cases, pigeons which are sometimes brightly, and almost always conspicuously coloured, and which are notoriously liable to the attacks of birds of prey, offer a serious exception to the rule, for they almost always build open and exposed nests. In another large family, that of the humming-birds, all the species build open nests, yet with some of the most gorgeous species the sexes are alike; and in the majority, the females, though less brilliant than the males, are brightly coloured. Nor can it be maintained that all female humming-birds, which are brightly coloured, escape detection by their tints being green, for some display on their upper surfaces red, blue, and other colours.*(2)", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "By the end of the 12th century they had become holy days of obligation across Europe and involved such traditions as ringing bells for the souls in purgatory. \"Souling\", the custom of baking and sharing soul cakes for \"all crysten christened souls\", has been suggested as the origin of trick-or-treating. Groups of poor people, often children, would go door-to-door on All Saints/All Souls collecting soul cakes, originally as a means of praying for souls in purgatory. Similar practices for the souls of the dead were found as far south as Italy. Shakespeare mentions the practice in his comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1593), when Speed accuses his master of \"puling [whimpering or whining] like a beggar at Hallowmas.\" The custom of wearing costumes has been linked to All Saints/All Souls by Prince Sorie Conteh, who wrote: \"It was traditionally believed that the souls of the departed wandered the earth until All Saints' Day, and All Hallows' Eve provided one last chance for the dead to gain vengeance on their enemies before moving to the next world. In order to avoid being recognised by any soul that might be seeking such vengeance, people would don masks or costumes to disguise their identities\". In Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, Nicholas Rogers explained Halloween jack-o'-lanterns as originally being representations of souls in purgatory. In Brittany children would set candles in skulls in graveyards.", "label": "clean"}

But one nice thing about it is that, if you squinted, you could read it as “our hedge decreased in value, yes (and by $2bn), but that’s because the underlying portfolio increased in value (by $8bn), so net-net we’re way ahead, and it was a hedge, and whaddarya gonna do, hedges go down when things-hedged go up, that’s life.” That turned out to be an entirely wrong reading but hey they tried!", "label": "clean"}

In Cleveland, readers will recall the great debates over the Gateway development regarding downtown redevelopment and professional sports. Playhouse Square recently announced that it generates $43m a year in economic activity. A couple years ago the Cleveland Museum of Art declared that its annual impact to the region was $22.3m. The Cleveland Clinic and University Hospital systems are conservatively worth many billions a year in terms of regional economic impact. A month ago, Cleveland State University issued a study declaring its impact to be $254m on the regional economy.

Most of the people I know who claim to have not been able to follow this movie properly were those that did not know the story from previous incarnations, and I can see how the final revelation of the mole in British intelligence is perhaps a little bit too oblique – and the final death a bit too convenient-seeming (unless you’re read the book, where it is made clear that the parties in question had a pre-arranged rendezvous). This may be considered a bit of a failing from a story-telling standpoint and the subplot involving Tom hardy’s Ricky Tarr is perhaps made too prominent at the expense of clarity. Additionally one could argue that Oldman is perhaps too beholden at times to Alec Guinness’ TV portrayal but this movie has virtues all its own, especially in its masterly use of flashback. And the 70s atmosphere is brilliantly caught, the final use of a Julio Iglesias recording brilliantly judged in my view. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.", "label": "clean"}

U.S. criminal law also prohibits conspiracy and attempt to violate these provisions, as well as obstructing enforcement of these provisions.

{"text": "February22 @ @ RandyP comments: mypad:FaithOfJesuskjv@Matthew:13:24-30 WHILE MEN SLEPT - The Kingdom sowed but, certain men were apparently given the responsibility of watching over the field and did not. While they slept the enemy came in and planted near identical yet false seed. This parable goes hand in hand with the original Parable of the Sower. Wouldn't it be good to know that along with your personal struggle to bring forth fruit that there is a field (world) of other believers going through the same process? Wouldn't it be equally as good to know that not everyone that you would think by appearance is of the same stock? No one would know until the final fruit was harvested. It is interesting that all the enemy had to do is plant the seed and then go about his way. Are these darnel seeds subject to the same process of root and depth and parching sunlight as the wheat? Most likely. Is one required to grow the other? Apparently not. What then is the difference and how can they be identified? Not even the servants from above can tell until the final fruit is bore. Once intermingled, removing the one would uproot the other. Imagine for instance the prospects of the Protestant church if ever the Catholic Church was removed or vise versa. The faith of our Lord is in that while this did not need to happen it was going to and did happen because men do sleep. It is deceptive to say that all paths lead to God when not all seed leads to the same fruit, when not all seed is planted to the same intent by the same kingdom. While we cannot identify the measure now amongst ourselves, He certainly can when all things come to fruition.", "label": "clean"}

St. John was a very intelligent person and Fr. Seraphim had this genius level IQ, but Fr. Seraphim consciously, deliberately humbled his mind. If you remember in the last talk we had, I said that Fr. Seraphim said, “I crucify my mind.” So he became like St. John. In fact, I said that St. John was a model for him. Well, he was a model for him in all ways. In presenting the theology of the Church, Fr. Seraphim was very much like St. John. Fr. Seraphim took as his example for presenting theology St. John. In fact, in an article he wrote for the 10th anniversary of St. John’s repose in 1976, he talked about the theology of St. John and began by relating a service that he had attended in San Francisco in the convent of Abbess Ariadna which was under St. John. Abbess Ariadna was a close disciple of St. John. It was the Feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God, and Fr. Seraphim, at that time Eugene Rose, was of the mindset “do we have to believe these accounts about all the Apostles being brought from the ends of the earth to attend the burial of the Mother of God? It sounds a little bit hard to believe”. Then he heard from the Abbess, during her sermon, who said, “We must believe the teaching of the Church. We must believe it simply and not doubt.” Fr. Seraphim was struck in his heart like that. He understood that we have to be simple, we have to believe simply what is handed down to us in the Church. Fr. Seraphim wrote in this article that he found that simple faith, that simple childlike faith, in St. John. That became his model for believing in the Church, believing in the theology of the Church, and presenting the theology and teaching of the Church to others.", "label": "clean"}

He grew up learning how to make wine by working beside his grandpa, dad and brother on their farm in Fresno. He then attended Fresno Pacific University where he mainly played soccer, studied Business Administration and Management, and worked at local wineries. After graduating, Nick coached soccer, played for a semi-pro league and assisted his family as they created their own wine label. In 2007, he moved to Napa to fully pursue a career in wine. He first scored a job at Del Dotto Vineyards giving wine and cave tours. Soon after, he became a Wine Specialist, Hospitality Liaison and Concierge at Vintner’s Collective, where he became acquainted with some of the best producers in the valley. Presently, Nick works alongside Mitch operating the wine and beer program at Carpe Diem. Nick’s lively presence and knowledge of wine simply reflects his love for the industry and all the people that he has met along the way.", "label": "clean"}

This rosy cincture encircling her middle stirred me deeply, suggestive as it was of tender punishment, exquisite suffering—I was thinking of the harem, no doubt, of branded houris and the like—and I would lie with my cheek resting on her midriff and trace the crimpled line of it with a slow fingertip, my breath stirring the shiny dark hairs at the base of her belly and in my ear the pings and plonks of her innards at their ceaseless work of transubstantiation. The skin was always hotter along that uneven, narrow track left by the elastic, where the blood crowded protectively to the surface.

{"text": "Fr. Damascene: Yes, the philosophy of the 20th Century is nihilism, quoting from Nietzsche. The other side of nihilism is chiliasm which is the belief that since there is no God and no heaven, let’s make the kingdom of God on this earth. That’s where this whole pampered, self-worshiping generation comes out of. He says that we have to realize that that is in ourselves—we have this nihilism in ourselves, this unbelief in ourselves, and we have to war against and struggle against it. That’s why he was able to see through the deceptions of the modern times, whereas many contemporary Orthodox Christians kind of go along with the spirit of the times. We can kind of mix Orthodoxy with the mind of the times, with the contemporary world view and cosmology. Fr. Seraphim was able to cut through that deception. Where the teachings of the Holy Fathers, for example, were at variance with the modern world view and cosmology, modern scientific theoretical models, Fr. Seraphim openly taught that these were incompatible, and this is the teaching of the Fathers. He did not try to make some artificial combination and force the teachings of the Fathers into the modern cosmology. He didn’t want to view Orthodoxy and the teachings of the Fathers from the point of view of a modern mind looking at them. He wanted to look at the modern world from the point of view of the Holy Fathers. In order to do that, he had to acquire the mind of the Fathers. In order to acquire the mind of the Fathers, he had to put to death his own mind. That’s why he said, “I crucify my mind.” That’s what makes him so special. He was this great intellect, but he crucified that mind, humbled it. He had that simple faith of St. John and all saints.", "label": "clean"}

Obviously Josh wants to have a higher completion percentage. We all do. But at the same time, you look at his yards per attempt, which was significant and both of the starting receivers and at their yards per catch, those were significant numbers in the NFL and that to me is very exciting to think that we can continue to build the offense and work on the defense, build the defense, knowing your quarterback is there, your running back is there, you’ve got your receivers and hopefully you’ll have your two All-Pro guards back and that’s going to make us that much better also.

He selected the specific site on the Potomac between Rock Creek and Goose Creek, while pretending to prefer a different location to hold down the purchase price for the lots. He appointed the commissioners, who reported directly to him rather than to Congress. He chose Pierre L’Enfant as chief architect, personally endorsing L’Enfant’s plan for a huge tract encompassing nine and a half square miles and thereby rejecting Jefferson’s preference for a small village that would gradually expand in favor of a massive area that would gradually fill up. When L’Enfant’s grandiose vision led to equivalently grandiose demands—he refused to take orders from the commissioners and responded to one stubborn owner of a key lot by blowing up his house—Washington fired him. He approved the sites for the presidential mansion and the Capitol as well as the architects who designed them.

{"text": "The nine Bachianas brasileiras explore a very different vein, although there is a hint of what is to come in the Fugato all\"antica of the Pequena suite. The admiration of Villa-Lobos for Bach had been fostered by his aunt Zizinha and in the Bachianas brasileiras Villa-Lobos draws double inspiration from both Bach and Brazil, although technical indebtedness to the former may be relatively superficial or at other times pervasive. It is, however, always the spirit of Bach that is evoked, the ultimate source of inspiration. The series, variously scored, began in 1930 with a work for an orchestra consisting of at least eight cellos and ended in 1945 with the ninth of the series, for string orchestra. From the second of the Bachianas brasileiras comes O trenzinho do caipira (The Countryman\"s Little Train), the fourth and last movement, a Tocata, arranged by the composer for cello and piano and used by him in this version during concert tours over a period of nine months after his return to Brazil in 1930. The little train represents the ancient steam-train of the interior of Brazil and suggests both the train itself and the Brazilian hinterland through which it passes.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Years of war and internal dislocation have produced substantial integration of ethnic and linguistic groups, particularly in the coastal areas, where as much as half of the population resides. The largest ethno-linguistic group, approximately 40 percent of the country's population, is Ovimbundu, whose traditional region includes much of the south-central part of the country. Although the Ovimbundu form the base for UNITA, there is little evidence of systematic discrimination against them by the Government or other groups. Other important ethno-linguistic groups include the Bakongo in the north; Kimbundu in the north-central area; and Chokwe in the far east. The coastal population centered in Luanda and, to a lesser extent, Benguela-Lobito, predominantly speaks Portuguese as a first language. The Portuguese-speaking group includes a large minority of \"Mesticos\" of mixed European and African ancestry and a small, white, predominantly Portuguese-descended population. In addition approximately 30,000 Portuguese citizens live in the country, forming the bulk of the nonrefugee expatriate community.", "label": "clean"}

Finally, in 1997, well after the disappearance of my teenage angst, I arrived here on a book tour.

Yes, I was somewhat taken aback by the Stetsons and cowboy boots, which to my Easterner's eyes seemed so cornpone and affectedly retro they made me laugh. Yes, I noticed the slightly solar aspect that everyone had, as if they were all a bit stoned on sunlight and long views, and, for that, unsettlingly cheery. And I noticed, too, that Boulder, which I visited at the time, struck me as having such excessively groomed streets and inhabitants that it seemed more a kind of mammoth swim club than a city. What I couldn't tell anybody, as I made my authorial rounds, was that I was secretly heartbroken to find that there was no magical soap bubble of hip floating over the street corners of Denver; no civic monopoly on cool.

{"text": "“Another option for mitigating a global warming would be to try to control the global radiation balance by limiting the amount of incoming radiation from the sun. This could be done by increasing the reflectivity of the earth, i.e., the albedo. Proposals for increasing the whiteness of roofs and surface features would have some effect, but only a fraction of incident solar radiation reaches the earth’s surface and a purposeful change in albedo would have more impact if done high in the atmosphere. According to Ramanathan (1988), an increase in planetary albedo of just 0.5 percent is sufficient to halve the effect of a CO2 doubling. Placing a screen in the atmosphere or low earth orbit could take several forms: it could involve changing the quantity or character of cloud cover, it could take the form of a continuous sheet, or it could be divided into many ”mirrors” or a cloud of dust. Preliminary characterizations of some of the possibilities that might be considered are provided below.”", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "May12 @ @ RandyP comments: mypad:FaithOfJesuskjv@Mark:3:20-30 - The friends close to Jesus suspect the toll of this ministry on a man to be greater than it actually is on Jesus. Perhaps they are beginning to feel the wear on themselves. Jesus had just returned from a prayer filled time of reinvigoration and reorganization; did they? Jesus' daily life was filled with such moments even in the midst of such business; was theirs? Even when the day became too busy and too crowded even to eat, Jesus would spend entire nights soaking in the Fathers communion; did they? Those that oppose Jesus never seem to tire because there are so many of them coming from so many directions; an endless supply of them so that one individual never has to tire. Add to it that even for one opponent it is so much easier to portray a foe in a negative light than it is to advance the cause and work of the much better light. At this point opponents don't have to reason nor defend what they are saying, just throw it out there like a sniper then run and hide till the next. Eventually the opponent however comes to the point where He has discounted the integrity and work of the Holy Spirit to such a measure that he either passively or vigorously aligns his own self with the workings of the Devil. If the Spirit is working to establish Jesus as Messiah and you are working against that, well matters have become quiet grave for you mister junior devil. Some people might do this for a time, come to the realization of who Jesus is and then repent. For those who continue on however, repentance and salvation are far from reach. What forgiveness from damnation would one ever hope to have? This is the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, not finding repentance, not allow the Spirit's work to continue inside of you. The faith of our Lord is well reasoned, though we may not allow ourselves to see it as so. Friend's think He is beside Himself, enemies think that He is an agent of Satan, neither of which can defend their statements. Not only is He in line, He does everything spiritual to keep Himself in line. Do we?", "label": "clean"}

The warden watched the individual for about 15 minutes before he heard a gunshot in the distance beyond the truck. When the subject spotted the warden, he immediately got out his phone and appeared to calling someone. The warden started his truck and continued down the road giving the subject the perception that he was leaving. After waiting down the road for a while, the warden returned to the location where the subject was parked and spotted another male with his son near the truck shooting at several doves well after sunset. The warden parked his truck and walked several hundred yards to make contact with the hunters. When he arrived, the hunter with his son was no longer there. The lone hunter was in compliance with state laws and told the warden that the other man was his cousin and was heading back to the house. The man was stalling answering questions about the other hunter as if buying time for his cousin’s escape. The warden was able to make it back to his patrol truck, drive to the front of the property, and find the hunter before he got away. As the warden tried to conduct a compliance check on the man, he denied hunting and became verbally aggressive. The warden advised Williamson County of the situation and requested back up. When two deputies arrived, the man became more compliant, admitted to hunting and said he hid his shotgun in his cousin’s truck. It was discovered that the man not only shot at a dove after sunset, but he did not have a hunting license, or identification.", "label": "clean"}
{"text": "The grafting style we use is called “cleft style.” As you see in this video, we slice the stock stem down the center and insert the tapered grafting tip into the slit. Then we carefully wrap it with Parafilm, which is commonly used in laboratories. It holds the grafted tip tightly in place, seals the cutting area and helps the cut surfaces not to dry out. In two weeks, the tip tissue connects to the stock and it starts growing. The key to successful grafting is for the stock stem to be young and fresh (the inside green with no pith). Sometimes the Artemisia stem accepts the graft with some pith inside, but it’s difficult to get good results. Matching the stem thickness between stock stem and grafting tip is also important to connect the vascular systems together.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "No matter how crafty they are, modern industrial-scale breweries can’t do things the old-fashioned way. The recipe and ingredients can match a 500-year-old Belgian formula, but when working with mass quantities, it’d be downright irresponsible to haphazardly introduce the variables that allow lambics to develop dozens of tasty microorganisms. Remember, until a few years ago, our craft-beer quality controllers regarded the now-trendy wild yeast Brettanomyces only as a possible contaminant. Paul Arney understands this history from his 15 years at Deschutes Brewery. At Oregon’s largest independent brewery, Arney ran one of the pub-only breweries that functions as an R&D department, developing early versions of recipes that would go on to become Red Chair IPA and the first oak-aged version of Jubelale. Arney, who struck out on his own in 2011, is taking a leap based on the belief that interesting character comes from critters most breweries sterilize away. “Beer is an incredible medium for creativity beyond just the raw materials,” he writes by email. “How the brewer brings the beer through the brewery is equally, if not more, important.” Which brings us to Sahalie, currently on Portland shelves for about $25. It’s difficult to describe, because I’ve never had anything quite like it. The extremely effervescent Sahalie floats more than sips, with thin layers of honey, lemongrass and grape covering the blond base like phyllo dough. This is a nuanced beer: If the funkiness of traditional Belgians is James Brown’s Live at the Apollo, Sahalie is Prince’s Purple Rain. Most exciting of all? This is only the third concoction Arney has made by blending test fermentations gathered at his little workshop in the wilds outside Bend, so we’re only in the earliest trials.

Later, at a meeting at The Core, Ellie pitches an idea for a series of sexual health on campus, though Jesse turns down the idea and tries to move onto the next one. Ellie, however, keeps trying to defend her idea, and Jesse tells her that the idea is dead, and to stop pitching it.

If you suspect that your child has ADHD, it is important to have your child evaluated by his or her doctor. In order for your child’s doctor to diagnose your child with ADHD, the behaviors must appear before age 7 and continue for at least six months. The symptoms must also create impairment in at least two areas of the child's life-in the classroom, on the playground, at home, in the community, or in social settings. Many children have difficulties with their attention but attention problems are not always cue to ADHD. For example, stressful life events and other childhood conditions such as problems with schoolwork caused by a learning disability or anxiety and depression can interfere with attention.", "label": "clean"}

One of the important things is to make sure you have a fresh football team and I think coach did a great job with that and I think that’s why, in the last game, you saw us play so well. Something can be said because it was different than ever before, and you can say that different might be exhausting, but at the end of the day it was just different and I thought our players responded very well and respected the approach that Greg Schiano took with them, and he was always up front with them as they went through the process, saying this week we’re going to wear pads and in the last six weeks you only get three opportunities to wear pads and you’re only going to have them on for this long, and the players knew what was going on.

Flutracking results were consistent with previous findings that the 2009 seasonal influenza vaccine was ineffective in preventing the dominant pH1N109 strain of influenza, and that 2007 and 2008 vaccine strains were considered well matched to the circulating virus in Australia.

But in so far as the maritime obligations may, consistently with those principles, be separately adjudicated, there is no objection to the jurisdiction of the admiralty pro tanto. This is clearly intimated in Turner v. Beacham, [24 Fed.] Fed.Cas. [page 350,] No. 14252, and The Pennsylvania, 154 F. 9 (C.C.A.2), though the decisions did not require such a holding.

Most of this new expansion is sponsored by Chinese investment or the Asian Development Bank, and managed by Chinese companies. In Kyrgyzstan, the main roads are rapidly improving, but marginal and remote mountain districts ? such as the Chatkal Valley ? remain isolated.

{"text": "As a matter of regulating the procedure in its own state courts, the California Supreme Court has decided that mandamus or declaratory relief rather than inverse condemnation provides \"the appropriate relief\" for one who challenges a regulation as a taking. Agins v. Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d, at 277, 598 P.2d, at 31. This statement in Agins can be interpreted in two quite different ways. First, it may merely require the property owner to exhaust his equitable remedies before asserting any claim for damages. Under that reading, a postponement of any consideration of monetary relief, or even a requirement that a \"temporary regulatory taking\" claim be asserted in a separate proceeding after the temporary interference has ended, would not violate the Federal Constitution. Second, the Agins opinion may be read to indicate that California courts will never award damages for a temporary regulatory taking. 15 Even if we assume that such a rigid rule would bar recovery in the California courts in a few meritorious cases, we should not allow a litigant to challenge the rule unless his complaint contains allegations explaining why declaratory relief would not provide him with an adequate remedy, and unless his complaint at least complies with the California rule of procedure to the extent that the rule is clearly legitimate. Since the First Amendment is not implicated, the fact that California's rule may be somewhat \"overbroad\" is no reason for permitting a party to complain about the impact of the rule on other property owners [482 U.S. 304, 338] who actually file complaints that call California's rule into question.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "There is some suggestion that knowledge of events associated with onset is “intriguing, but unnecessary for successful treatment.” (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299) I call shenanigans. There is a significant connection between the onset of TM and the patient enduring loss, perceived loss, and/or trauma. Time is well spent exploring the specific environmental stressors that precipitated the disorder. Although ignoring circumstances surrounding onset might be prudent when employing strict behavioral treatment paradigms, it seems like a terrible waste of time to endure suffering without identifying some underlying meaning or purpose that would otherwise be missed if we overlook onset specifics. “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” (Frankl, 1997, p. 86) If we acknowledge that all behavior is purposeful, then we must know and understand the circumstances around onset if we will ever understand the purpose of said behavior. I liken this to a difference in professional opinion and personal preference because either position can be reasonably justified, but in the end the patient should make the ultimate decision about whether or not to explore onset contributions vis-à-vis “imagery dialogue” or a similar technique. (Young, Klosko, & Weishaar, 2003, p. 123) If such imagery techniques are unsuccessful or undesired by the client, a psychodynamic conversation between “internal parts of oneself” can add clarity to the persistent inability of the client to delay gratification. (Ingram, 2012, p. 292) Such explorations are likely to be time consuming, comparatively speaking, and should not be explored with patients who are bound by strict EAP requirements or managed care restrictions on the type and length of treatment. Comorbid developmental disabilities and cognitive deficits may preclude this existential exploration. I employ the exploration of existential issues of origin in the interest of increasing treatment motivation, promoting adherence, enhancing the therapeutic milieu, and thwarting subsequent lapses by anchoring cognitive dissonance to a concrete event.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Available N requirements (soil N + fertilizer N) for MEY increased linearly with water for both growing seasons. The slopes of the lines for the two seasons were similar and indicate that N requirements increased approximately 8 lbs N with each inch of additional water. However, the intercepts for the lines differ for the two seasons. As a result, it took approximately 35 to 40 lbs/a less N in 1994 to achieve MEY than in 1993 at similar water levels. Background soil N analysis levels for the two seasons were similar. However, barley residue from the preceding crop was burned prior to seeding the 1994 oat crop. This likely enhanced organic N mineralization and resulted in the lower calculated N requirement. Typically, most cereal growers do not burn their residue, hence under most situations the upper line in Figure 3 is probably the better predictor of fertilizer N needs. Using this approach, sufficient fertilizer N should be applied to achieve 60 lbs available N/a where 8 inches of available water (soil water + rainfall) is expected during the growing season. If water conditions improve, N application is increased approximately 8 lbs/a per inch increase in available water.", "label": "clean"}

From grain shifters, slicers, LFO modulation, echo, reverb, flanger, delay, filters to various combinations. Eight memory locations are provided above the touch pad to store your favorites, along with any pad motion recording, pad hold status and position, plus values for fx depth and fx release. Also, another attractive point of the KP3 is its ability to apply effects to the input of the unit, with or without samples playing back, effectively using it as a real-time effects processor. As this device begs to be used live, it does a great job at sampling the input or re-sampling the output on the fly. Another nice extra is the ability of the KP3 to provide a tap tempo and it has auto-BPM detection to beat-sync its tempo to the input (sometimes the sync is sloppy but you can help it by tapping the tap tempo button, indicating to the KP3 where the beat is). This tempo can be output in MIDI to clock other devices, as well as any button you push or activity on the touch pad can transmit/receive MIDI for the option to record and playback your performances in a sequencer.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "A main character’s name often gives you the first clue to what a novel is “about,” especially when it’s also the title of the book. A good example turns up in Olive Kitteridge, the collection of linked short stories that won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. A just-picked olive is as bitter — and the color olive is as drab — as the title character of the book appears at first to be. The salt added during curing removes the bitterness just as love, the salt in this book, removes some of Olive’s. In Ireland a kitter is a left-handed person. And Olive is at least metaphorically left-handed: She’s out of sync with others in her coastal town in Maine. A surname database says of Kitter: “This is an Olde English or Anglo-Saxon pre 10th Century name which derives from the word ‘Cyta’ and is a nickname of the medieval period generally given to one of fairly violent attitudes.” Olive’s views of life are “fairly violent,” especially in the first story, when they are so angry they verge on caricature.", "label": "clean"}

Law enforcement continued to face challenges in identifying child victims of sex trafficking, particularly because the victims are often provided false identification by their traffickers and at least initially self-identified as adults. There was no targeted federal funding to support state child welfare agencies' anti-trafficking efforts. In some states, state child welfare agencies' missions did not formally extend to human trafficking, focusing instead on children who have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by caretakers and have not been expanded to reflect the anti-trafficking policy developments of the last decade. NGOs reported that these programs generally did not assist children over 14 years of age. State and local law enforcement, in some jurisdictions, was hampered by a lack of mandates, protocols, and training to identify and respond to child trafficking victims. The challenge of incorporating modern anti-trafficking concepts into these existing institutions has resulted in misidentification and referrals to juvenile justice or immigration systems rather than protective services. During the reporting period, the states of Illinois, Georgia, New York, Connecticut, and Florida created new procedures to increase identification or conducted initiatives to train child protection workers on human trafficking.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Next, In case that some of his Arguments shall not be thought of the most Cogent sort that may be, he hopes it will be consider'd that it ought not to be Expected, that they should be So. For, his Part being chiefly but to propose Doubts and Scruples, he does enough, if he shews that his Adversaries Arguments are not strongly Concluding, though his own be not so neither. And if there should appear any disagreement betwixt the things he delivers in divers passages, he hopes it will be consider'd, that it is not necessary that all the things a Sceptick Proposes, should be consonant ; since it being his work to Suggest doubts against the Opinion he questions, it is allowable for him to propose two or more severall Hypotheses about the same thing : And to say that it may be accounted for this way, or that way, or the other way, though these ways be perhaps inconsistent among Themselves. Because it is enough for him, if either of the proposed Hypotheses be but as probable as that he calls a question. And if he proposes many that are Each of them probable, he does the more satisfie his doubts, by making it appear the more difficult to be sure, that that which they alwayes differ from is the true. And our Carneades by holding the Negative, he has this Advantage, that if among all the Instances he brings to invalidate all the Vulgar Doctrine of those be Disputes with, any one be Irrefragable, that alone is sufficient to overthrow a Doctrine which Universally asserts what he opposes. For, it cannot be true, that all Bodies whatsoever that are reckon'd among the Perfectly mixt Ones, are Compounded of such a Determinate Number of such or such Ingredients, in case any one such Body can be produc'd, that is not so compounded ; and he hopes too, that Accurateness will be the less expected from him ; because his undertaking obliges him to maintain such Opinions in Chymistry, and that chiefly by Chymical Arguments, as are Contrary to the very Principles of the Chymists ; From whose writings it is not Therefore like he should receive any intentional Assistance, except from some Passages of the Bold and Ingenious Helmont, with whom he yet disagrees in many things ( which reduce him to explicate Divers Chymical Phaenomena, according to other Notions ; ) And of whose Ratiocinations , not only some seem very Extravagant, but even the Rest are not wont to be as considerable as his Experiments. And though it be True indeed, that some Aristotelians have occasionally written against the Chymical Doctrine he Oppugnes, yet since they have done it according to their Principles, And since our Carneades must as well oppose their Hypothesis as that of the Spagyrist, he was fain to fight his Adverfaries with their own Weapons, Those of the Peripatetick being Improper, if not hurtfull for a Person of his Tenents ; besides that those Aristotelians, ( at Least, those he met with, ) that have written against the Chymists, seem to have had so little Experimental Knowledge in Chymical Matters, that by their frequent Mistakes and unskilfull way of Oppugning, they have too often expos'd Themselves to the Derision of their Adversaries, for writing so Confidently against what they appear so little to understand.", "label": "clean"}

Artisanal miners are a heterogeneous group of men aged from 16 to 60+ years, and their reasons for mining are varied. For some, mining was and still is the main source of cash income. Gold helped them to survive in the turbulent economic transition period of 1992?2000. For others it is an income supplement in winter months when agricultural activities are limited. In any case, artisanal gold mining is beyond the control of central and Local authorities and the increasing degree of labour mechanization and the use of mercury for fine gold extraction are growing threats to the mountain environment.", "label": "clean"}

And then I remember I had this vision that I'd be playing in a stadium as a drummer behind everything but THEN probably it was actually an accident, I don't know - well, shit happens, let us put it that way. I started to be a singer and I enjoy being a singer. I like to be on the stage and to sing the songs that I love to sing. But I'm kind of a shy person, which means off the stage sometimes I'm not that open that I can talk to strange people unlike the American way. They have this culture with small talk and in Finland we don't have that! We're shy, and we wanna keep everything to ourselves. Actually I think that probably I am a singer because on stage I subconsciously want to fight my fear of meeting people; a shyness that especially very many other musicians and actors have. They are shy people but they're like trying to fight their shyness. But I like to be singer! It's nice to have some attention, while in my private live, I don't know, I really don’t wanna have any of that. Sometimes it's boring especially if you go to a bar. If you want to talk to people, to other musicians, and there're only 10 people around you staring at you and you're like what the fuck am I doing now? Really… it's not that nice.", "label": "clean"}

To seek Him to develop it within us? To seek as a distant wish or as daily presentable action? To hunger and thirst for His righteousness? What does it mean to knock then?

The other nice thing about teaching is how it flexible it can be. Many times, the teacher can suggest a day and time that works best for them. When possible, I try to do most of my teaching at 6 PM classes, and that way when I have a full time in-house job, the class won't interfere.", "label": "clean"}

The gain is as great as viewing the planetary system after the fashion of Copernicus, instead of that of Ptolemy. There is nothing contrary to experience in supposing that conflicting physiological actions may be perceived with a distinctness quite disproportionate to their real efficacy. We may compare the conflict between faintly perceived activities of one kind and clearly perceived activities of another kind, to that between troops dressed in a uniform scarcely distinguishable from the background with others clad in staring scarlet. We must be content to admit that our consciousness has a very inexact cognisance of the physiological battles in our brain, and that the mystery why apparently weak motives of one class should invariably get the better of apparently strong motives of another class, lies wholly in the word ‘apparently’.

It really depends on the child and whether they are playing a game for entertainment or as a vehicle for escapism. Escapism is extremely dangerous during a survival scenario.

Just as the hilly Menilmontant district of Paris has a bas-relief quality in “The Red Balloon” that adds to the feeling of fantasy and reality intermingling, the endless wetlands of France’s Camargue region—where the land and sea become one—are an intricate part of the story of “White Mane.” Both films have brilliantly choreographed chase scenes, and they both contain amazing footage of the camera following characters as they are running.

{"text": "We may now consider Mr. Wallace's arguments in regard to the sexual colouration of birds. He believes that the bright tints originally acquired through sexual selection by the males would in all, or almost all cases, have been transmitted to the females, unless the transference had been checked through natural selection. I may here remind the reader that various facts opposed to this view have already been given under reptiles, amphibians, fishes and lepidoptera. Mr. Wallace rests his belief chiefly, but not exclusively, as we shall see in the next chapter, on the following statement,* that when both sexes are coloured in a very conspicuous manner, the nest is of such a nature as to conceal the sitting bird; but when there is a marked contrast of colour between the sexes, the male being gay and the female dull-coloured, the nest is open and exposes the sitting bird to view. This coincidence, as far as it goes, certainly seems to favour the belief that the females which sit on open nests have been specially modified for the sake of protection; but we shall presently see that there is another and more probable explanation, namely, that conspicuous females have acquired the instinct of building domed nests oftener than dull-coloured birds. Mr. Wallace admits that there are, as might have been expected, some exceptions to his two rules, but it is a question whether the exceptions are not so numerous as seriously to invalidate them.", "label": "clean"}

In budding yeast, a surveillance mechanism known as the spindle position checkpoint ensures that exit from mitosis only occurs when the anaphase nucleus is positioned along the mother-bud axis. We identified the protein kinase Kin4 as a component of the spindle position checkpoint. KIN4 prevents exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned nuclei by inhibiting the mitotic exit network (MEN), a GTPase signaling cascade that promotes exit from mitosis. Kin4 is active in cells with mispositioned nuclei and predominantly localizes to mother cells, where it is ideally situated to inhibit MEN signaling at spindle pole bodies (SPBs) when anaphase spindle elongation occurs within the mother cell.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Keys to Productive Rehearsals- With all training, you want to make it as realistic as possible. Rehearsals are the same way. Go through all the details in a full rehearsal and pretend like it is the real thing. If you take the rehearsal seriously, so will other people in your family and prepper group. If you are going to bug-out, make sure everyone knows what they are grabbing if you have to leave the house in under five minutes. Make sure everyone has a role to fulfill that fits into your larger plan. If your son is supposed to grab the mobile stove and does not know where to find it, it is better to find that out now in a rehearsal instead of in real life. If he is responsible for setting up the stove once you arrive to the bug-out site, make him do it. Have him set it up in a safe location, start the fire (if he’s old enough), and then cook something on it. Maybe he uses too few briquettes the first time, so he has to add more the next time around. Everyone should be very familiar with the equipment they will be using. An emergency is not the time to figure out how a stove works or if you are missing some part that you need. Break out some of your survival food for realism, and so that everyone can get used to eating it. I can tell you from experience, if you are used to eating only fresh foods and then have to immediately switch to a steady diet of Meals-Ready-to-Eat, you are going to have a very rough transition.

Currently, this poor mechanism for the collection and disbursement of seed costs undermines the relationship and trust between kitchen gardeners and stakeholders. The VHCs are supposed to collect and manage the funds, but gardeners are resistant to pay because they do not have a clear understanding of the intended use of the money.

We have studied the importance of root growth and N uptake to a depth of 2.5 m in fully grown field vegetables and cover crops by use of minirhizotrons and deep point placement of 15N. Deep rooted crucifereous crops were found to have high root densities to a depth of 1.5-2 m and high 15N uptake to this depth. The work shows that knowledge of the interactions between root growth and soil N below a depth of 1 m are important to understand crop N uptake and nitrate leaching from agro-ecosystems.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "So what does it mean? It's the ratio of these lever arms. That's what it's telling me. I can look, so I raise the pressure up to two. And so here's xB at two, here's yB at two. And I'm here somewhere. And this little amount and this little amount, that's that difference. And it's just telling me that ratio of those arms is the ratio of the total number of moles of gas to liquid. And that's great. Because now when I go back to the problem that we were just looking at, where I say, well I'm going to purify the less volatile component by raising the pressure until I'm at coexistence starting in the gas phase. Raise the pressure, I've got some liquid. But I also want some finite amount of liquid. But I don't want to just, when I get the very, very first drop of liquid now collected, of course it's enriched in the less volatile component. But there may be a minuscule amount, right? So I'll raise the pressure a bit more. I'll go up in pressure. And now, of course, when I do that the amount of enrichment of the liquid isn't as big as it was if I just raised it up enough to barely have any liquid. Then I'd be out here. But I've got more material in the liquid phase to collect. And that's what this allows me to calculate. Is how much do I get in the end. So it's very handy. You can also see, if I go all the way to the limit where the mole fraction in the liquid at the end is equal to what it was in the gas when I started, what that says is that there's no more gas left any more. In other words, these two things are equal. If I go all the way to the point where I've got all the, this is the amount I started with, in the pure gas phase, now I keep raising it all the way. Until I've got the same mole fraction in the liquid. Of course, we know what that really means. That means that I've gone all the way from pure gas to pure liquid. And the mole fraction in that case has to be the same. And what this is just telling us mathematically is, when that happens this is zero. That means I don't have any gas left. Yeah.", "label": "clean"}

Oh, we were cold in our drafty summer cottage that winter, but were too afraid to light the space heaters or ask to borrow blankets. I didn’t know anyone.

He talks about why he sees genetic determinism as \"action at a distance thinking,\" and why he thinks it is similar to creationist views, and describes both as \"magical ways of thinking about nature.\" He explains epigenetics. He describes how certain non-genetic factors that shape behavior may be inherited from one generation to the next. He discusses \"sexual freaks\" and sexual ambiguity in nature, and shows how in many ways, it is the norm in nature. He predicts the extinction of creationist thinking, and talks about how freaks of nature are a missed opportunity for those science advocates battling intelligent design and creationism, even as he also criticizes belief in \"evolution's design\" and \"magical genes.\" He contrasts his views with those of evolutionary psychology as regards brain development.

Rather than mere lessons, the Institute stressed the actual, vivid experiencing of art as much as possible. Like the literary generation of 1898, they also, in a sense, rediscovered Spain's cultural heritage, by extolling the value of Spanish folklore, architecture and painting. It was, for example, a disciple of Don Francisco, Manuel de Cossio, who rediscovered the forgotten and neglected El Greco for Spaniards and the rest of the world.", "label": "clean"}

New hires have to be smart enough to know what they don’t know, and not have such an ego that they aren’t willing to do what it takes to learn the business. It’s not to say they shouldn’t have confidence or speak up and disagree, but successful businesses don’t have room or time for a battle of egos that takes focus away from the issues or decisions at hand. Additionally, lack of humility often means that employees are afraid to admit when they’re wrong or ask for help. That won’t work in the early days of a startup. Humility is especially important in new hires who need to be willing to pitch in at any level and be able to move forward with decisions that are made, even if they disagree. - Susan Strayer, Exaqueo", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Kev, the key is what type of liquor license is involved. If you have a \"Full\" license in New York State, it includes all types of liquor such as wine, beer and hard liquor such as whiskey, vodka, tequila etc. I usually recommend only a beer and wine license which costs about 1/3 as much and there is a lot fewer problems. It takes a lot to let someone get drunk on wine and beer if the staff is paying attention. This is best for the coffee shop/wine bar location. Your place can be family friendly especially at brunch. You really want to have kids only up to the early afternoon if you want to be successful. Plus families with children are not the people you want in your joint if you want to make money. They are normally on a budget and take up space that is better utilized by singles that come to your joint to socialize. What you also need to do is get a large selection of nondescript wines from Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Chile and put the per bottle price at a high number. Then have a lot of half price nights and afternoons so you still get your profit margin. For example you can get some great wines at $4.95 wholesale and price them at $40. On half price day you still get $20 a bottle. Your goal is to get the price of the bottle in just one drink. Then you start making money and you can pay waitresses, bartenders and your jazz combo’s. This presupposes that your goal is to have a viable business that will survive. If you want to provide a community meeting place, just start a bonfire, link hands, and starting singing Kumbaya.

We have consistently maintained our principled position of opposition to harmonisation of taxes or any movement away from unanimity in decision-making. We have always pointed out that a competitive corporation tax rate has been a key element of successive Governments’ policies. Tax competition is beneficial, not harmful. Others who respect our success are free to emulate us. They are not free to oblige us to increase or harmonise our taxes. No provision in the current treaties or the Lisbon reform treaty gives the power to other member states or the Union’s institutions to affect our tax rates. Taxation remains a key national competence. No amount of spinning by the treaty’s opponents can change this. I hope the comments by the chairman of the Referendum Commission, Mr. Justice O’Neill, will put this particular canard back in its box until the next referendum, when no doubt it will be resuscitated.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "SMAS represents a continuation of the superficial cervical fascia into the face. The corresponding deep layer of cervical fascia continuing into the face is called parotidomasseteric fascia. The facial nerve lies deep to it. In the parotid area, facial nerve is protected by the superficial lobe of the parotid gland. In the cheek area, facial nerve runs deep to the parotidomasseteric fascia. The motor branches reach the superficial mimetic muscles through their deeper aspect. Only the buccinator, the levator anguli oris, and the mentalis muscle lie deeper to the plane of the facial nerve and receive their innervations from their superficial surface. The exception is the frontal branch of the facial nerve, which lies deep to the SMAS in the temporal area when it exits from the parotid gland. It crosses the junction of the anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3 of the zygomatic arch. Above the arch it travels within the SMAS (aka temporoparietal fascia or superficial layer of the temporal fascia). At temporal area, SMAS crosses in front of the zygomatic arch and adheres to the periostium by thin expansion. Therefore dissection in the area carries a high risk of nerve injury.", "label": "clean"}

Perhaps not as \"pretty\" as the Sony Nex or the Olympus EPLs (probably why I hadn't really considered them as much during my online research), but quite nice and solid.", "label": "clean"}

While more severe injury was associated with higher overall rates of sleep disturbances in our sample, milder injury was the most predictive factor in a multivariate model with demographic and psychosocial factors. Children with more severe (versus milder) injury may have also had systematic differences in demographic and psychosocial factors that were also related to increased sleep problems. In addition, it has been proposed that persons with mild TBI may have increased recognition of post-injury impairments, and therefore may be more likely to report sleep disturbances as an injury complication. In children with mild TBI, sleep disturbances may also be a symptom of increased awareness of post-injury changes subsequently reported by parents and caregivers. Finally, it is unknown whether there is a physiological or neuroanatomical basis unique to mild TBI injury to account for this finding. Further work is warranted in this area.", "label": "clean"}

I want to look at them, we're gonna come back to them, but they start to highlight things we can do with our classes. So I've built one simple version of it here, which is per. And notice I've got another method, right up here, called say. And say takes two arguments, for the moment the second argument, or the first argument's, not going to make a lot of sense, but say takes two arguments besides itself. It's going to take another object to which it's saying something and the thing to say. Since I only have one object here, I'm going to have person talk to himself. You may have met a few other undergraduates who have this behavior. I'll have him talk to himself and say, just some random message the faculty members occasionally worry about. OK, what does this thing do? Now you're going to see some of the power of this. Again, remember, I'm down here, I'm sending this the message say, it's going to go up the chain to find the say message in person. And what does say do, it says given another object and some string, it's going to return, oh, and interesting things, part of which you can't see on the screen. First what it does, is it gets first name of self. Remember self is pointing to this instance, so it's simply looks up that binding, which is Frank. It's going to create a string in which it adds to that the family name of self, and then another thing that says to, and then ah, I'm now going to send a message to the other object, saying give me your first name. Going to add that to the second piece, and you can see in this case it happens to be the same first and family name. And then at the end of it, which you can't see here but you can see in your handout, I just append the whole string, so it spits it out.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Distinguishing between a fair and unfair tackle in soccer can be difficult. For referees, choosing to call a foul often requires a decision despite some level of ambiguity. We were interested in whether a well documented perceptual-motor bias associated with reading direction influenced foul judgments. Prior studies have shown that readers of left-to-right languages tend to think of prototypical events as unfolding concordantly, from left-to-right in space. It follows that events moving from right-to-left should be perceived as atypical and relatively debased. In an experiment using a go/no-go task and photographs taken from real games, participants made more foul calls for pictures depicting left-moving events compared to pictures depicting right-moving events. These data suggest that two referees watching the same play from distinct vantage points may be differentially predisposed to call a foul.", "label": "clean"}

Victor Matfield believes the victory will give the Springboks a psychological advantage over the French as they may meet in the knock out stages of the Rugby World Cup 2011. The crushing victory over the French was achieved through five tries with Pierre Spies, Guthro Steenkamp, and Francois Louw each scoring one try and Gio Aplon, the 75 kg wing, scoring two tries. Their final preparations for the 2010 Tri-Nations tournament includes two internationals against Italy. In the first test a lacklustre Springbok team beat Italy by 29–13.

After reviewing their graded test, students completed the final three reflection questions, including a categorization of test mistakes and a list of changes to implement in preparation for the next test. Thompson then collected and made copies of the wrappers returned them to the students several days later, reminding them to consider what they planned to do differently or the same in preparation for the upcoming test. Thompson reports that each reflection exercise required only 8-10 minutes of class time. Clara Hardy and others also describes uses exam wrappers.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "A daily hike to high mountain pastures (about 7000ft). Two energetic dogs were so happy to meet and run together : a tourist Beagle (my Ninio) and a resident Jack Russel. A young French lady lives in the small stone house for the Summer Season while the cows graze up there. Her window opens on a bare landscape but for a few “arolle” trees. There are a special kind of pines (Pinus Cembra) which resist the low temperatures in Winter. Her window also opens on a vast corrie of mountains. The lady is the cheese maker of this particular pasture. The large round pieces of cheese she produces are very sought-after for their particular taste. If cows could speak, they would tell you how good the grass tastes up there with all the wild flowers covering the pastures from June till end of August.This is my kitchen window at home. One I never tire to look through at any Season. At this time of the year the greenness is dazzling. The rowan-tree attracts lots of birds who take their turn more or less patiently to eat its berries. It is noisy, happily so. The wheat field is blazing under the sun. In the evening I love to stand there and watch the sun disappearing slowly behind the forest. I am so lucky – and grateful – to live so close to nature !", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "I'm not surprised you've been shocked by some of the comments left. I've been pretty shocked too.The thing that is the most shocking to me is that people are posting the most horrific stories of flagrant abuse by TSO's like patients with a medical need, babies and small children being denied water and food! A basic, human right and yet the TSA is confiscating baby food, telling parents just how much food they can bring to feed their children. The TSA is abusing the elderly and the sick by forcing them to remove shoes and belts, throwing away water, confiscating needed medicines or creams and so much more. I'm shocked at how many stories there are of items so commonplace as to be ridiculous being confiscated.Please, post a video of an explosive that can be made to resemble peanut butter (down to the smell), or strawberry jam, or barbecue sauce or any of the other hundreds of thousands of items that people carry with them on a daily basis. I've seen some answers to some of the questions here, but I've yet to see anyone address the liquids ban convincingly. If it looks like peanut butter and it smells like peanut butter, why is it considered a \"gel\"? It's food, not a dangerous substance! If I'm facing a 2-3 hour pre-boarding time, plus a 5-6 hour flight, yes I want to bring real food with me and so do people who are diabetic, have medical conditions, are traveling with children or have dietary restrictions for any reason. The TSA counters that you can get food behind the security check but for real, when one single banana costs $1.50 or more, a small 16 oz. bottle of water goes for $2-3 and there isn't any \"real\" food to get behind the security lines besides an expensive, greasy pile of fries or a scone from Starbuck's this is just not an option. And as countless people have pointed out, you can't find baby food or formula behind those security lines. Neither can you find healthy food, vegetarian food, halal food, kosher food, vegan food, inexpensive food, non-wheat-based food (celiac disease), low-sodium food, or any other number of representative dietary restrictions. Flying is an all-day ordeal for many, as there are very few cross-country flights which don't have at least one stop, and yet the TSA expects people not to pack food! Some of the ridiculous items I've personally had confiscated in this specific category: a brick of solid cream cheese (a gel!) a home-packed tub of chunky peanut butter (a gel!) slices of cheese (a gel! how do you slice a gel? It's a mystery!). Not to mention the countless times that I have had to throw out a half a 4 oz. bottle of expensive face cream, even though there was clearly not even close to 4 oz. left in the bottle. The most frustrating part is when you say, \"well we can't post our rules, then the \"terrists will win\"and then you get all upset with us, the traveling public, when we can't follow the rules you won't tell us about! And then, when we run into something like never stopping to consider that something as commonplace and easily identifiable as peanut butter will get taken away, because we've never thought about it as a \"gel\", well we're just told to shut up and follow the rules! Then we are told we can't see a list that says something as simple as \"food items such as cheese and peanut butter fall under the \"gel\" category, so don't even try\" because the the \"terrists\" would know that peanut butter and cheese were banned substances! Follow the logic on that one for a minute!", "label": "clean"}

Of course cats have nine lives (although you would think they had all been spent long ago concerning the economy), where the idea here is - so what if the global economy falls off its apple cart again - the feds will just print more money.

{"text": "In addition, while cycling into the city, and out to Hindmarsh on Saturday night, I might have expected to see a number of cyclists using the path to get into town. Guess how many I saw at 6.30 pm on what was a comparatively mild night? None. None at all. No other cyclists the whole trip. This is ridiculous; the route should be awash with people riding bikes. This particularly struck me as I came out under the bridge into Elder Park. It was deserted. What is a beautiful boulevard and riverfront promenade through the heart of Adelaide was completely desolate, not a soul in sight. This felt bizarre, where were all the people? One thing that struck me - if we want to get more people cycling into the city using Linear Park then it has to be safe, convenient, fun and amenable. Adelaide City Council has spent a lot of money on making Elder Park and the river front area of the city really attractive. But it is money wasted if people don’t go there. One reason I would think that most average cyclists wont ride a bike at night into the city via Linear park (and miss out on the safety and convenience of a quiet off-road cycling route) is that the approach to the city, both east and west is completely unlit. Pitch black it is from Hackney Bridge to the zoo, and once you go under the train line at Bonython Park and head out towards the brewery then you really want to make sure that you have eaten your carrots. This needs to change. The whole point of crime prevention through urban design", "label": "clean"}

So you can clean it up and then you can use the same shell and use that facility with probably no new capital costs and now have it produce electricity with Brown's Gas instead.

Amulek is teaching the Zoramites, who are dissenters from among the Nephites, who had already been taught concerning Christ, but then had apostatized from the truth. Amulek is warning the Zoramites that if they do not repent in this life, they, having once had the truth and rejected it, will not be saved. The context had nothing to do with salvation for the dead, or baptism for the dead, which is primarily for those who never had the opportunity to hear the Gospel and repent in this life. The Zoramite situation, as apostates and dissenters is obviously quite different from those who die without a knowledge of the Gospel", "label": "clean"}

In 4000 BC the land beside the Thames was 46 feet (14 m) higher than it is now, and in 3000 BC it was some 31 feet (9.4 m) higher. When this is combined with the water issuing from the dissolution of the polar ice-caps, the tides moving up the lower reaches of the Thames are increasing at a rate of 2 feet (0.6 m) per century. That is why the recently erected Thames Barrier will not provide protection enough, and another barrier is being proposed.", "label": "clean"}

Nearly a fourth of the homeless interviewed were between the ages of 18 and 34 years old. A little over a fourth were 55 years or older. Forty-two percent were working full or part-time. As the 100,000 Homes campaign points out, medical research has highlighted several health and social conditions that make people more likely to die on the street. Of those interviewed in Fairfax, 105, or 23 percent, have permanent physical disabilities that limit their mobility. Eighty individuals, or 17 percent, have had serious brain injury or head trauma. Of those surveyed, 165, or 36 percent, are mentally ill. Using the survey indicators, that means there are 107 individuals or nearly a quarter of those interviewed who are at risk of mortality because they are homeless.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Current electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels, with their associated CO2 emissions, in very large power stations which waste much of their primary input energy. More energy is lost as the power is moved around the electricity grid network and converted from high transmission voltage down to a supply suitable for domestic or commercial consumers. The system is innately vulnerable to disruption: localised technical, weather-related or even deliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting in widespread blackouts. Whichever technology is used to generate electricity within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitably be subject to some, or all, of these problems. At the core of the Energy [R]evolution there therefore needs to be a change in the way that energy is both produced and distributed.", "label": "clean"}

If so, where is the area where I should pour in the sealant? Please help me. As I don't know where the radiator is (where to put in the sealer). I can't afford to pay a mechanic and this is the only car I have. Also, after the fluids are put in, do I let the car sit for a certain time until the fluids penetrate accordingly thus \"sealing any leaks there may be\" or can I drive the car and if so how soon?", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Fr. Damascene: Well, he gave the teachings of the Fathers on dealing with sexual temptations and passions. Of course, he recognized that this was a very prevalent problem in our times. I think it’s more prevalent today since his repose, with Internet pornography. It’s a new thing the devil has invented to tempt people. In one letter that he wrote to a spiritual son he said, “Flee quickly to the prayer of Jesus,” quoting from Abbot Barsanuphius of Gaza which he translated. He says, “Flee quickly to the prayer of Jesus and you will find repose. Pray ceaselessly, saying ‘Lord Jesus Christ, deliver me from shameful passions.’” So he would counsel to turn to God in prayer. If we turn to God in prayer, first of all, we can’t be indulging in these sexual passions in our mind or physically if we’re in the presence of God and conscious of God’s presence. Fr. Seraphim constantly had God in his mind. His mind and heart were directed toward heaven and God. If we have our mind in heaven like that, then we won’t be going down to the earth to these sinful passions. So, first of all, raising the mind to God in that way is a major help. Secondly, God does help. We pray to God, and it’s not just the fact that we’re turning our mind to him. It’s not just psychologically, but we are receiving God’s grace and help. There were other counsels he gave concerning avoiding over familiarity with people with whom you might be tempted to have a sinful relationship with.

Pauline had seen it first, but she said nothing about it to her husband until he himself saw it. \"It must have been over seven-foot tall, because we could not see its face.\" It was described as three feet wide, surrounded by a luminous glow. Its box shaped helmet framed a dark square area in which no face was visible. They called the BUFORA investigator Randall Jones Pugh, and the police immediately, but the figure had gone before they arrived. Mrs Coombs and her family had been involved in two other UFO incidents prior to this encounter. (Sources: Hugh Turnbull, FSR, June 1977, p. 6, citing Western Telegraph, April 28, 1977; David F.

{"text": "The Gophers knew they would be challenged up front by Western Michigan's pass-heavy tendencies. Pressure on Broncos senior QB Alex Carder came and went. Carder wasn't constantly bothered as UNLV and New Hampshire's QBs were in the first two games. Carder tried to mix it up between quick passes and waiting for his receivers to get in position for the deep throw. The results varied. Carder never fully got into a rhythm - more a credit to the secondary than the D-line. DE D.L. Wilhite overtook NT Ra'Shede Hageman for the team lead in sacks by chasing Carder and bringing him to the ground to end a 10-play drive in the second quarter. The Gophers' second sack of the game came in a big situation on Western Michigan's final drive of the game, when a touchdown would have likely won it. After WMU was called for an illegal formation, DE Michael Amaefula followed on the next play by sacking Carder and pushing the Broncos into a second and 20. Three plays later the game was over. Kill mentioned how the team was surprised by how much Western Michigan decided to run. The Broncos tallied 38 rushing attempts - most by any \"U\" opponent this season -- for 165 yards. The D-line was lagging in rush defense as the unit was beat to the corners numerous times. The line combined for its lowest number of tackles on the year (nine) -- they recorded 15 at UNLV and 16 against New Hampshire. Amaefula, Hageman and junior Roland Johnson led the unit with two apiece - all of which were solo tackles.

PSC detractors have often blurred the discussion of the inadequacy of the facilities with the operation and management of the pool. But the City taking over operation of the pool does not in anyway guarantee that a new pool complex will be built soon. And, of course, a new pool complex would be even more expensive to operate and maintain.", "label": "clean"}

Our little boy's head has finally started catching up and he's quite the string bean despite his hefty appetite. The doc was pleased and offered some temporary relief for T-babe's everpresent eczema. He said new research shows bathing every day with soap really helps the condition by removing as much staff bacteria present on the skin, which can later cause the allergic reaction. As long as we get lotion on him within 5min. of his bath, we're golden! I found this extremely encouraging. My thoughts were, the dryer the skin, the less one should bathe. Look what I knew!

{"text": "Another set of suggestions came from Dave DeMaw, who also spoke at the meeting: \"We have a basic problem of conflicting ideologies at WWUH. Because WWUH is a college station many think that anything goes. And, because we bill ourselves as the Public Alternative, an infinite number of interpretations arise. One faction believes that WWUH exists primarily to serve the public, thus more public affairs shows are requested. A second faction operates on the premise that students are working at the station without benefit of money or credits in lieu of the radio experience that they will need when job hunting. It is my contention that while we exist to serve the public, we also exist to train students who are interested in a broadcasting career. By offering the public a non-continuous format, we reap a very small audience. Therefore, we are not serving the public at large. Granted, we cannot challenge WDRC or WHCN in the ratings, but we can grab a much larger slice of the pie by taking a close look at our format and by making some major changed in programming. I suggest that we keep the specialty music shows, but air more toward rock and jazz. We should rid ourselves of morning classics and opera Matinee. Public affairs should have a wider scope and should cover the Hartford area. Get rid of the syndicated shows that have no interest but simply fill time. Public Affairs should be aired on the weekends, as done at commercial radio stations. Rock shows should contain ample amounts of the announcer's personality, but certain requirements should be met (e.g., a required play list of new releases).\"", "label": "clean"}

On one flight recently, however, I checked my bag .. but forgot to lock the suitcase. Thus, the lock was attached and secured, but not preventing the suitcase from being opened. When the bag arrived, the lock was removed, gone. Only a TSA person could have removed the lock.March 23, 2008 11:44 AM I work in bags and I see locks that have fallen off via the belt system all the time. Sometimes they don't lock all the way (even tho we think that they do) sometimes they pop open, sometimes they get ripped off. I'm sorry that that happened to you but it is not always TSA's fault. Anonymous said... On a direct flight from Memphis to Detroit, jewelry was stolen from my suitcase. The jewelry was packed inside of a box, which was packed inside of a zipped up bagged. The jewelry were the only items taken, and no card was left to indicate that my luggage had been searched. I know that my suitcase had been tampered with, because the zippers were in a different location than where I put them. The only time my suitcase was out of my possession was when I turned it in to the TSA people at the airport in Memphis. The only way someone could have known that the jewelry was there was via Xray. My claims with TSA and the airlines were denied. Now, you tell me - who could have pulled off this theft? It MUST have involved a TSA employee, perhaps in cahoots with someone from the airlines. In any case, DON'T TRUST ANYONE with TSA. They're human beings and not all of them are honest!March 23, 2008 3:45 PMGuess what?

{"text": "I had a extremely unpleasant encounter with the TSA officers while traveling through the San Diego airport SAN last saturday (March 22, 2008). How it happened was that I somehow set off the metal detector alarm, I have absolutely no idea how that is possible because the ONLY metallic thing on my body was the underwire in my bra, and other people that I was traveling with were able to walk through with belts on, change in their pockets, jewelry, ect without setting off the same exact metal detector's alarm. So, I was pulled inside and put into the \"box\" that is on the other side of the metal detectors. As I was standing in there, I politely asked if I or possibly one of the officers could retrieve my stuff which included a brand new laptop, a purse with cash, cellphone and bag, because other passengers were knocking my laptop around and moving it while retrieving their own bags, also I was concerned that my things could be stolen (since airports are one of the highest theft areas). The officer rudely snapped at me \"You cannot leave here, and don't worry about your stuff.\" While I waited, my laptop was knocked onto the floor, and upon turning it on I found that the screen is now damaged. I was treated like a criminal and told to stand in the \"box\" and not allowed to even place my objects in a safe place. Then they used the wand and patted me down as if I were a criminal. That wouldn't have been so bad if the security officers would not have been complete jerks (There other words that describe them much better). While the officer was waving the wand over my chest area it kept going off, and it was mysteriously going off while passing over my shoulder. The officer rudely asked if I had anything metallic in my shoulder or chest area, and I told her maybe underwire in my bra, but I have no idea why it would be going off while passing my shoulder. Then the officer became even ruder with me. The she patted down my shoulder/chest area, and I was already wearing a skin-tight shirt, it was pretty obvious that there was nothing in this area of my body. Then while searching my bag, the officer asked me if I had anything 'round' in my bag. I had a confused look and said \"I'm not sure\", and then the officer began to yell at me. I'm sorry that I did not take an inventory of the various shapes of the items that I had packed in my bag. \"Do you have anything round?\" is such a vague and off-hand question that my only quick on the response could be something like \"I'm not sure.\" Then the officer opened my jewelry bag, and a piece of jewelry fell on the floor and the officer just stepped on it like it was nothing. When I reached to pick it up to place it on the table she yelled \"DO NOT TOUCH THAT.\"I really hate being treated like a criminal and my personal possessions treated like garbage. The saddest thing is that my story isn't nearly as bad as other stories of read on this blog or reports that I have heard on the news. My heart goes out to all of the people who have been harassed and abused by TSA people. Thank you TSA for allowing my brand new $2,000 computer to be broken. (I could not have it retrieved when I asked POLITELY, and of course laptops have to come out of their protective padded bags.)Also, thank you TSA for treating me like a CRIMINAL. The terrorists are getting what they wanted. Our civil liberties and freedoms are being chipped away one by one, and the Bill of Rights is being thrown out the window. I hope these TSA officers enjoy their jobs of treating innocent people like criminals and pieces of crap.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily, in the case of Samurai: Son of Death), Hirata's work left little imprint on the American comics scene. In 1987, American comics fans were obsessed with samurai manga, but they liked another samurai manga: Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima's Lone Wolf and Cub. Despite their similarities of style and subject matter (lots of Tokugawa-period architecture, swords, ugly men on horses), Hirata's art is very different from Kojima's. In contrast to Kojima, whose panels are sometimes sketchy, Hirata's work is intensely detailed: you just want to stop and stare at every panel to catch everything. When Kojima draws an action scene, he uses lots of quick cuts and speedlines; but when Hirata draws an action scene, he uses big panels and puts the figures right in the foreground, often many figures at once, all posed so you can see every rippling muscle. Basically, Kojima's style is more \"manga,\" and Hirata's style is more \"Western,\" or sort of a mix between the two. In Hirata's work, as in traditional American comics, each page or panel is a full composition, but Kojima's work is all about the cinematic effects and the flow. Was Hirata's work actually too similar to American comics to catch on in America? Or was it just that Frank Miller preferred Lone Wolf and Cub? In either case, it was twenty years until Dark Horse published the first full Hirata graphic novel series, Samurai Gishiden (\"The Legend of the Satsuma Samurai\").", "label": "clean"}

The Provincial Administration's duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools, residences, government buildings, and roads, and the promotion of arts, culture, and nature conservation.

{"text": "April26 @ @ RandyP comments: mypad:FaithOfJesus HAIL - I would think that Jesus imagined days like today as a young man; this day and the day after the judgement. Imagine the joy that He would have actually coming to this group of women. I love how the four gospels give an unintentional sense of confusion (not contradiction) and chaos over the events simply because there would be. Much like eyewitness testimony in a court case, we are left to piecing details together into a cohesive sequence, much is happening at one time. There is confusion, excitement, joy, fear, tears, relief, reverence, fulfillment, disbelief, new belief, all the emotions that one would expect. For the angels watching upon this, they have to be busting out in heaven don't they? This isn't the end of their work by a long shot but, this resurrection is a huge piece. Jesus seems very calm and dignified about this all, still focused on the task ahead. At the same time He has to be excited about seeing and revealing His living breathing glorified self to these loyal brethren. Like a liter of young pups they will be running up quite surprised and tails a wagging, barking gleefully thrilled to see their Master. After thousands of years of preparation for this, this has to be a big moment for Him too. And it seems only fitting that the first revelation was to these women who had been and were this dawn ministering so faithfully to Him. The faith of our Lord is very much like a Shepherd, very much like a parent, very much like a master. The work is hard but, the rewards very pleasing. The work continues but, our Lord of all people has to know how big and great this accomplishment of His is today.", "label": "clean"}

She just kept alive a suit claiming that the company’s executives had acted illegally when they falsely claimed to be following tough underwriting standards in making mortgage loans. She was not making new law. Responding to the last banking crisis, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected a bank’s puffery defense that had been accepted by a lower court judge. “If a defendant represents that its lending practices are ‘conservative’ and that its collateralization is ‘adequate,’ the securities laws are clearly implicated if it nevertheless intentionally or recklessly omits certain facts contradicting these representations,” the court wrote. “By addressing the quality of a particular management practice, a defendant declares the subject of its representation to be material to the reasonable shareholder, and thus is bound to speak truthfully.”", "label": "clean"}

In the case of the complex special linear group SL(n,C), the compact real form is the special unitary group SU(n) and the split real form is the real special linear group SL(n,R).

It’s intense, but being inside a cauldron tends to be that way! And I haven’t even mentioned the upcoming Venus-Mars conjunction in Libra in square to the nodal axis. If any two immortals enjoyed an erotic relationship, it was Venus and Mars. Their union rocked the entire pantheon and, in some myths, created Eros himself. Their upcoming rendezvous will last for 5 days (August 17 – 22nd) in Venus’ own sign, where she tantalizes, disarms, and satisfies Mars in a way no other Goddess could. This is Love…Erotic, transformative Love. We have to look deeply now, deep into our own situation and into our own relationship beliefs, and determine if we are ready to be true to our self and to the greater Universe for each of us are our own little Universe, encased in flesh, grounded in human form. When we are able to be the Fool and to trust and have faith in higher process, we are at once a building block for Higher Source and a Universe in our own right. It is our responsibility to become, to grow, to evolve...the fears we face are but obstacles on the path making us ever more resilient and ever stronger a foundational block upon which to build.

So, Star Trek was just a job and I was playing a rather stuffy bureaucrat, not the most appealing character. I was not a Star Trek fan. I didn’t watch the show. I used to be big on reading science fiction. I used to read a magazine called Astounding Science Fiction, but I stopped doing that around 1948. I remember the year because that was the year L. Ron Hubbard wrote a piece for Astounding Science Fiction called “Dianetics,” and that was the beginning of Scientology. It was launched in Astounding Science Fiction. He used to write space operas, as they called them. He was not terribly good at it, I didn’t think.

Some would say that He took it into Himself and thus bare it. Others would say that He lifted it or carried it away to some other place and thus bare it. The fact is that we do not know for certain. There is the verse that say by His stripes we are healed; those stripes generally considered to be at His scourging before the Roman soldiers; suggesting more of a payment/price paid rather than a consumption. Could these healings have been paid on a promissary note? The faith of our Lord in this regard is in the prophet Isaiah, that through him (and select others) the Father had beforehand mandated the steps to be followed by the Christ. Not only was Jesus given the ability to do so He had the mandate to follow, it was then left to His willingness and obedience to accomplish. Even if we are not sure of the where sickness, we have the what how and the why.", "label": "clean"}

Constant unsolicited offers for credit cards, banks loaning money to the homeless (figuratively? literally?), people using home equity as an ATM, putting daily necessities on revolving credit- all this fiscal insanity is now coming home to roost. Now that the truth is slowly trickling out about the severity of the situation, from the Federal government to huge corperations to State and local governments to your neighbor next door, things are going to change. Banks, which make money by lending the same dollar out to five or ten people have suddenly decided to get picky about the customers to which they loan. Verifyable income, tangible collateral, and excellent credit scores seem to be irrelevent today. It seems their questionable buisness practices of the past several years (decades?) have come back to bite them big time. So now in the fantasy world of the Federal Reserve they just fire up the printing presses one more time.

{"text": "Hemodynamic management designed to optimize cardiac output and stroke volume can significantly lower the risk of perioperative morbidity, and, in some cases, mortality. The implications of the POISE trial, which upended the previously accumulating data in support of indiscriminate perioperative β-blockade by demonstrating worsened outcomes, were supported by high-quality, propensity-matched, prospectively collected data. Data supporting the safety of colloid use has been threatened by the retraction of 88 publications of a single author, as well as prospective, nonrandomized data, suggesting increased renal morbidity in critically ill patients receiving synthetic colloids. Large datasets continue to suggest an association between red blood cell transfusion and mortality. Analysis of the operating room strongly implicates anesthesia providers as a potential mechanism for bacterial contamination.", "label": "clean"}
{"text": "Washington is a far more conservative town than New York or Los Angeles, and it shows in the region's art production. With cutting edge, international exhibitions a regular part of the Hirshhorn Museum's schedule and New York only a four-hour drive away it's surprising that there isn't more challenging, thought-provoking art created and shown here. True to his curator's statement, the work that Campello selected seldom pushes the boundaries of contemporary art. Instead Seven is a representation of some of the best Washington-area art. With the exception of the mostly tepid painting, the work is strong and the thoughtful installations more engrossing than a mere group hang. The success of the show, at least among the DC art crowd, should encourage more exhibits of local artists and add to the development of an audience here for the art-making that exists between touristy paintings of landmarks and the sometimes hermetic world of the professional gallery/museum scene.", "label": "clean"}

Such dust might be delivered to the stratosphere by various means, including being fired with large rifles or rockets or being lifted by hydrogen or hot-air balloons. These possibilities appear feasible, economical, and capable of mitigating the effect of as much CO2 equivalent per year as we care to pay for. (Lifting dust, or soot, to the tropopause or the low stratosphere with aircraft may be limited, at low cost, to the mitigation of 8 to 80 Gt CO2 equivalent per year.) Such systems could probably be put into full effect within a year or two of a decision to do so, and mitigation effects would begin immediately. Because dust falls out naturally, if the delivery of dust were stopped, mitigation effects would cease within about 6 months for dust (or soot) delivered to the tropopause and within a couple of years for dust delivered to the midstratosphere.”", "label": "clean"}

Indeed, deeper and more protracted strains on financial markets pose the main downside risk for the global economy. An intensification of problems in U.S. housing and credit markets could further slow the U.S. economy and weigh on the arc of the recovery.

When you choose \"I don't have a choice\" you are playing \"victim\" to your original commitment (or choice) and/or the circumstances that surround you. I call this running on \"auto-pilot\". \"I made the commitment, I HAVE to follow through\". No, you don't HAVE TO. Do you run on \"auto-pilot\" out of a sense of \"integrity\" or \"have to\"? In doing so, you're giving your power away to someone or something other than yourself. You'll likely feel stress, overwhelm, out of control and intense time pressures. The \"choice\" to stay in \"I don't have a choice\" is an energy drain and dis-empowering, and ultimately creates a negative impact on your performance and your health.

{"text": "The cases that the Court relies upon for the proposition that there is no distinction between temporary and permanent takings, see ante, at 318, are inapposite, for they all deal with physical takings - where the diminution of value test is inapplicable. 8 None of those cases is controversial; the state [482 U.S. 304, 332] certainly may not occupy an individual's home for a month and then escape compensation by leaving and declaring the occupation \"temporary.\" But what does that have to do with the proper inquiry for regulatory takings? Why should there be a constitutional distinction between a permanent restriction that only reduces the economic value of the property by a fraction - perhaps one-third - and a restriction that merely postpones the development of a property for a fraction of its useful life - presumably far less than a third? In the former instance, no taking has occurred; in the latter case, the Court now proclaims that compensation for a taking must be provided. The Court makes no effort to explain these irreconcilable results. Instead, without any attempt to fit its proclamation into our regulatory takings cases, the Court boldly announces that once a property owner makes out a claim that a regulation would constitute a taking if allowed to stand, then he or she is entitled to damages for the period of time between its enactment and its invalidation.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "--- CUSTOM ADAPTATION --- PURPOSE: To provide proper positioning for a child with multiple disabilities, including cerebral palsy and lung disease. The family owned a Medifab seat and insert that was used in the car and provided appropriate positioning and support. However, they found it inconvenient to transfer the seat from the car to the house each time it was needed. The solution was to create another shell for the seat insert using an existing Medifab mobile base frame that was not being used. The seat insert was measured and a plywood shell and footrest were made to fit. The next step was to determine how to fit the new shell in the frame. The frame has adjustable legs with casters at the bottom, and a plate at each side with multiple holes in arcs that had enabled the original seat to be tilted. A metal frame was added to the seat shell, along with two fixed pins at the front corners and two spring-loaded retractable pins at the back corners. The front pins fit into the grooves at the front of the side plates on the base frame. The back pins fit into the arc of holes at the back of the side plates. The spring-loaded pins are attached to handles that are squeezed to retract the pins to tilt the seat to the desired angle. A piece of bent steel was then attached to the bottom of the shell to mount the footrest. The steel has a series of holes which enable the footrest to be adjusted down to accommodate future growth. Attachments are also mounted on each side of the shell to accommodate an existing tray, which can be adjusted backwards and forwards using different holes in the shell. With the shell completed, it was possible to unclip the insert from the seat in the car, position it in the indoor shell and base, and place the removable tray in position, creating a high chair that can be used for eating and other activities. DIMENSIONS: The footrest can be adjusted 120 millimeters down in 20 millimeter increments. TITLE: All in the Family. JOURNAL: TAD Journal. REF: Volume 25, Number 4, Summer 2005. PAGES: 12-14.

Or if the government destroys a chicken farm by building a road through it or flying planes over it, removing the road or terminating the flights would not palliate the physical damage that had already occurred. These examples are consistent with the rule that even minimal physical occupations constitute takings which give rise to a duty to compensate. See Loretto v.

Nor is there a web of statutory or regulatory policies obscuring that information, nor much expense nor logistical difficulty in gathering it. To the contrary, computerized government services like PACER make it possible to access court filings concerning any federal defendant from the comfort of one's home or office, quite unlike the 'diligent search of courthouse files, county archives, and local police stations throughout the country' that a citizen would have had to undertake to replicate the contents of a rap sheet... In addition, newspapers regularly report on federal prosecutions, and their accounts can easily be found on the Internet. Indeed, by routinely issuing press releases that name the individuals that it has indicted, and then naming them again when they plead guilty or are convicted, the Justice Department has itself made the process infinitely easier. If someone wants to know whether his neighbor or potential employee has been indicted for, convicted of, or pled guilty to a federal offense, he may well find out by simply entering a Google search for that person's name.\"", "label": "clean"}

Given that economic activity and manufacturing depend primarily upon energy, nations will do their best to achieve control over these energy resources. The Islamic world is not using its resources effectively, for many of its members lack the infrastructure and technology to increase the production and use their natural resources to develop their industries. Therefore, the resources' contributions to the country's economy are limited to export earnings. These countries do not have the means to process their own crude oil, use it in their industrial complexes, or to develop their industries. Worse still, some Muslim nations do not even have the necessary means to explore and research their natural resources or to discover and extract them. Explorations undertaken by foreign companies reveal that other Muslim nations have oil and gas reserves, but they cannot benefit from their resources.", "label": "clean"}
