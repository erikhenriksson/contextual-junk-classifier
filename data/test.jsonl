It will be seen that the raypaths 22a followed by the signals generated at point B (FIG. 2) and/or point C (not shown) will differ substantially from the raypaths 22 generated from point A. Accordingly, by comparing the signals (e.g. arrival times, amplitudes, etc. of the S-waves and/or P-waves) received at each of the sensors 21 along strings 20a and 20b with the respective signals from the reference surveys taken at point B and/or C before the fracture was formed, a better approximation of both the length and the azimuth of the skewed fracture 11a can be made.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "5December2012 @ @ RandyP comments: I was thinking this morning in Daniel that this Old Testament is taking me through as master class in human government. I have seen from the time of Joseph through to the Pharaohs on through Joshua and Gideon and Saul and David and the line of kings down to the captivity the inner workings of a nation Israel/Judah. Now in captivity, I see the inner workings of one great empire and then a progression of other empires. I have seen the multiplicity of influence, the rolling cycles of affluence and poverty, the directions pulled and torn and put back together. I have seen leaders that stood for right, stood for wrong, stood for their own honor and shame. I've seen deceit, impulse, corruption, conspiracy along with murmuring and dissent. I've seen exile and banishment and insubordination and assassination. I've even seen the decrees of wise kings used against their better intents. I read today that the kingdoms of man are ruled by God and that He appoints whom He will over them. What then is trying to show us? What is the lesson I should take from this? Why has He spent so much written space to paint this picture for me? This master class... what does the final graded paper say?

And so, I was asking TJ, “Are there any conventions in component?” He’s like, “Well, not really except for maybe your object has a .el property that’s your root element.” And so basically, I had to make a set of widgets and then make up conventions for them on the fly. And as long as you use my widgets together, you have a framework. But if I wanted to use someone else’s micro component that used different conventions, then I’d have to shim it to be able to use it.", "label": "clean"}

Were they rather to have the faith that Jesus the Son of God Holy Redeemer was not to die in a sudden storm fierce as it was? Who brought the storm? In whose hands are is the storm controlled? Storms rage around us today, even storms of emotion and circumstance and consequence and accident. They are beyond our control. They threaten us with disaster and injury, even death.

Trust the Lord, lean not on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him.

They would come with these problems, and they were kind of agitated, coming from the world, and they were in the presence of Fr. Seraphim. Even though he didn’t have to say many words, that stillness was contagious. They caught that stillness and walked away feeling it. Another spiritual daughter of Fr. Seraphim, Barbara Murray, says that she would come to Fr. Seraphim with all kinds of perplexities, and she would wonder, “How am I going to deal with all these problems that I am facing in my life?” She would leave Fr. Seraphim and go to church and suddenly all the problems didn’t seem important at all. He had that stillness. Also, Fr. Alexi said that at the end of Fr. Seraphim’s life, right before he died (it was the last time he saw Fr. Seraphim before he got sick), he sat outdoors with Fr. Seraphim talking and he felt that very profoundly, that stillness that came from his being totally at peace.

As you can see in the photos the green kept its color better than the red during baking. Each egg was sliced across toward the top and bottom to give the dough room to expand in the oven. I put a band of the red paste across those, then added a green zig-zag and dots and then some red dots, too.

If you are wondering how we can do better, maybe Conrad Wolfram in this interview you can see on Wild About Math! has some ideas for you.

Apparently, finding an '03 4WD ES with the luxury pkg is difficult in the north east at this time. Another option is to forgo the luxury pkg for the DVD package (about the same price, and can't have both (can't have moon roof and DVD), so I don't feel like I'm sacrificing a toy). Another dealer I just happened to stop off at (Mazda Auto Network in Jamaica, NY) said they could get me this one for $600 under invoice. Sounds like a good deal, but I felt they were pressuring me too much. So I'll stick with the luxury & tow pkg Tribute from Great Neck Mazda (Great Neck, NY) if they do in fact have it. If they don't, $600 under invoice for choice #2 sounds pretty good as well. I still don't understand how these dealers can afford to sell something AT invoice, let alone UNDER it.

{"text": "Jane Austen and Bullwinkle Moose kept flittering through my thoughts as I listened to this book. Fitzwilliam Darcy's ill-considered proposal to Elizabeth Bennet has vague echoes of Miss Arabella Hunt's proposal of marriage to Tom Jones. \"In thus disposing of myself, I know I shall incur the censure of the world; but if I did not love you more than I fear the world, I should not be worthy of you...\" Further, like Darcy, she imputed to her intended her own thoughts and feelings only to find to her chagrin, she had completely misread the situation. In Fielding's sharply drawn caricatures of Squire Allworthy, Squire Weston, Mr. Blifil, one finds a cartoon melodramatic world with Snidely Whiplash tying lovely, hapless Nell to the railroad tracks with Dudley Do-Right riding to the rescue in the nick of time in a kind of prequel to the modern novel with Bullwinkle Moose as narrator. If you remember Bullwinkle telling Fractured Fairy Tales, then you have a sense of this tongue-in-cheek novel. The villains have big black mustaches; the good guys wear white hats; sometimes walk on the dark side and no good deed goes unpunished. In my time in the United States Navy, \"Going to school\" on someone is what we called watching experienced seamen and learning from mistakes made by others. It is evident that Fielding is one of the writers on which Miss Austen went to school, from the way she used strong caricatures in her novels such as Lady Catherine, Mrs. Bennet, Miss Bates, Sir John Middleton, Mrs. Jennings, Sir Walter Elliot, Mrs. Norris, et al. If you choose this book, be prepared to give the author time (8-10 chapters) to explain himself. It may be English but it \"ain't\" today's English. Charlton Griffin does a great narration and a wonderful job translating Fielding's humor for Twenty-First Century ears.

{"text": "TSA Screeners have a thankless job~The job the screeners do is extremely difficult with the limited tools they are provided...under often thankless conditions.Consider this;A. in the majority of airports the most 'private' space a screener can take a break, is usually a coffee shopB. often, when a supervisor needs to have a briefing with their team, they do it in a very public settingC. Being a screener is like being 'on stage' 8-10 hours per day...with every mis-step or frown being noticed D. Screeners are not empowered to effect change - how many times have you questioned a policy and gotten a 'good' answer? In LAS VEGAS, screeners are not required to yell over and over again for passengers to remove their electronics etc. In places like LAX where the screening checkpoints are bottlenecks, the pressure on screeners to move the line along means that they often don't actually stop the belt and examine every bag, as was once the mandatory practice (which was my experience in Austin, TX yesterday as well). * Note - an experienced x-ray operator can easily distinguish when a tub has nothing but a jacket and belt in it (for example), and having to stop the belt in that case is actually silly and somewhat of an insult to their experience and skill level; HOWEVER, when there are briefcases or electronics involved, it is alarming not to see the belt stopped. No one wants their bags checked...wants to take off their shoes and walk on dirty floors...to be treated like a security risk etc...yet these are the realities of the screening experience today. Maybe next time when traveling through the airport, we should all stop and ask ourselves, \"is it the screener making these rules, or Washington?\" Just maybe, we'll realize the screeners are just doing their job as instructed...and a letter to Washington is better than scorn for the screeners.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "A review of 61 studies on attitudes to trials has shed some light on why people participate in clinical trials (Edwards, Lilford and Hewison, 1998). In this review, it was found that over 60% of participants in seven studies stated that they did or would participate in clinical trials for altruistic reasons. However, in 4 studies, over 70% of people stated that they participated out of self-interest and in two studies over 50% of people stated that they would participate in such a study out of self-interest. As far as informed consent is concerned, in two studies (which were also part of this review) 47% of responding doctors thought that few patients were actually aware that they were taking part in a clinical trial. On the other hand, an audit of four further studies revealed that at least 80% of participants felt that they had made an autonomous decision. There is no proof whether such perceptions were accurate or not. The authors conclude that self-interest was more common than altruism amongst the reasons given for participating in clinical trials but draw attention to the poor quality of some of the studies reviewed thereby suggesting the need for further research. It should not be necessary for people to justify why they are willing to participate in clinical trials. Reasons for participating in research are further discussed in section 3.2.4 insofar as they relate to end-of-life research.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "To give the Reader an account, why the following Treatise, is suffer'd, to pass abroad so maim'd, and imperfect, I must inform him that 'tis now long since, that to gratify an ingenious Gentleman ; I set down some of the Reasons that kept me from fully acquiescing either in the Peripatetical ; or Chymical Doctrine, of the Material Principles of mixt Bodies. This Dircourse some years after falling into the hands of some Learned men, had the good luck to be so favourably receiv'd, and advantageously spoken of by them, that having had more then ordinary Invitations given me to make it publick, I thought fit to review it, that might retrench some things that seem'd fit to be shewn to every Reader, And substitute some of those other things that occurr'd to me of the tryals and observations I had since made. What became of my papers, I elsewhere mention in a Preface where I complain of it : But since I writ That, I found many sheets that belong'd to the subjects I am now about to discourse of. Wherefore seeing that I had then in my hands as much of the first Dialogue as was requisite to state the Case, and serve for an Introduction as well to the conference betwixt Carneades and Eleutherius, as to same other Dialogues, which for certain reasons are not now herewith publish'd, I resolv'd to supply, as well as I could, the Contents of a Paper belonging to the secund of the following Discourses, which I could not possibly retrive, though it were the chief of them all. And having once more try'd the Opinion of Friends, but not of the same, about this imperfect work, I found it such, that I was content in complyance with their Desires, that not only it should be publish'd, but that it should be publish'd as soon as conveniently might be. I had indeed all along the Dialogues spoken of my self, as of a third Person ; For, they containing Discourses which were among the first treatises that I ventur'd long ago to write of matters Philosophical, I had reason to desire, with the Painter, to , and bear what men would say of them, before I own'd my self to be their Author. But besides that now I find, 'tis not unknown to many who it is that writ them, I am made to believe that 'tis not inexpedient, they would be known to come from a Person not altogether a stranger to Chymical Affairs. And I made the lesse scruple to let them come abroad uncompleated, partly, because my affairs and Prae-ingagements to publish divers other Treatises allow'd me small hopes of being able in agreat while to compleat these Dialogues. And partly, because I am not unapt to think, that they may come abroad seasonably enough, though not for the Authors reputation, yet for other purposes. For I observe, that of late Chymistry begins, as indeed it deserves, to be cultivated by Learned Men who before despis'd it ; and to be pretended to by many who never cultivated it, that they may be thought not to ignore it : Whence it is come to passe, that divers Chymical Notions about Matters Philosophical are taken for granted and employ'd, and so adopted by very eminent writers both Naturalists and Physitians. Now this I fear may prove somewhat prejudicial to the Advancement of solid Philosophy : For though I am a great Lover of Chymical Experiments, and though I have no mean esteem of divers Chymical Remedies, yet I distinguish these from their Notions about the causes of things, and their manner of Generation. And for ought I can hitherto discern, there are a thousand Phaenomena in Nature, besides Multitude of Accidents relating to the humane Body ,which will scarcely be clearly & satisfactorily made out by them that confine themselves to deduce things from Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, and the other Notions peculiar to the Chymists, without taking much more Notice than they are wont to do, of the Motions and Figures, of the small Parts of Matter, and the other more Catholick and Fruitful affections of Bodies. Wherefore it will not perhaps be now unseasonable to let our Carneades warne Men, not to subscribe to the grand Doctrine of the Chymists touching their three Hypostatical Principles, till they have a little examin'd it, and consider'd, how they can clear it from his Objections, divers of which 'tis like they may never have thought on ; since a Chymist scarce would, and none but a Chymist could propose them. I hope also it will not be unacceptable to several Ingenious Persons, who are unwilling to determine of any important Controversie, without a previous consideration of what may be said on both sides, and yet have greater desires to understand Chymical Matters, than Opportunities of learning them, to find here together, besides several Experiments of my own purposely made to Illustrate the Doctrine of the Elements, divers others scarce to be met with, otherwise then Scatter'd among many Chymical Books. And to Find these Associated Experiments so Deliver'd as that an Ordinary Reader, if he be but Acquainted with the usuall Chymical Termes, may easily enough Understand Them ; and even a wary One may safely rely on Them. These Things I add, because a Person any Thing vers'd in the writings of Chymists cannot but Discern by their obscure, ambiguous, and almost AEnigmatical way of expressing what they pretend to Teach, that they have no Mind to be understood at all, but by the Sons of Art ( as they call them ) nor to be Understood even by these Without Difficulty and Hazardous Tryalls. lnsomuch that same of Them Scarce ever speak so candidly, as when they make use of that known Chymical Sentence ; . And as the obscurity of what some Writers deliver makes it very difficult to be understood ; so the Unfaithfulness of too many others makes it unfit to be reli'd on. For though unwillingly, Yet I must for the truths sake, and the Readers, warne him not to be forward to believe Chymical Experiments when they are set down only by way of Prescriptions, and not of Relations ; that is, unless he that delivers them mentions his doing it upon his own particular knowledge, or upon the Relation of some credible person, avowing it upon his own experience. For I am troubled, I must complain, that even Eminent writers, both Physitians and Philosophers, whom I can easily name, if it be requir'd , have of late suffer'd themselves to be so far impos'd upon, as to Publish and Build upon Chymical Experiments, which questionless they never try'd ; for if they had, they would, as well as I, have found them not to be true. And indeed it were to be wish'd, that now that those begin to quote Chymical Experiments that are not themselves Acqainted with Chymical Operations, men would Leave off that Indefinite Way of Vouching the Chymists say this, or the Chymists affirme that, and would rather for each Experiment they alledge name the Author or Authors, upon whose credit they relate it ; For, by this means they would secure themselves from the suspition of falshood ( to which the other Practice Exposes them ) and they would Leave the Reader to Judge of what is fit for him to Believe of what is Deliver'd, whilst they employ not their own great names to Countenance doubtfull Relations ; and they will also do Justice to the Inventors or Publishers of true Experiments, as well as upon the Obtruders of false ones. Whereas by that general Way of quoting the Chymists, the candid Writer is Defrauded of the particular Praise, and the Impostor escapes the Personal Disgrace that is due to him.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "In the eighth chapter instances were given, to which many might here be added, of variations occurring at various ages, and inherited at the corresponding age. It was also shewn that variations which occur late in life are commonly transmitted to the same sex in which they first appear; whilst variations occurring early in life are apt to be transmitted to both sexes; not that all the cases of sexually-limited transmission can thus be accounted for. It was further shewn that if a male bird varied by becoming brighter whilst young, such variations would be of no service until the age for reproduction had arrived, and there was competition between rival males. But in the case of birds living on the ground and commonly in need of the protection of dull colours, bright tints would be far more dangerous to the young and inexperienced than to the adult males. Consequently the males which varied in brightness whilst young would suffer much destruction and be eliminated through natural selection; on the other hand, the males which varied in this manner when nearly mature, notwithstanding that they were exposed to some additional danger, might survive, and from being favoured through sexual selection, would procreate their kind. As a relation often exists between the period of variation and the form of transmission, if the bright-coloured young males were destroyed and the mature ones were successful in their courtship, the males alone would acquire brilliant colours and would transmit them exclusively to their male offspring. But I by no means wish to maintain that the influence of age on the form of transmission, is the sole cause of the great difference in brilliancy between the sexes of many birds.", "label": "clean"}

Second, it would pose a significant danger to the superhero’s friends and family, who would become targets for his or her enemies.

{"text": "As you can see, up until now I have not been a regular review junkie but this is the third time I have used Magic Touch so I feel confident in saying without doubt that they are hands down the best and most honest Auto Body Shop around which is saying a lot for their type of work. I always get hives when needing to do any auto body work and feel I don't have enough time but that I need to shop, haggle and check at least two or three places to make sure I am getting a fair price. This is one of the few places I can now confidently say that I just don't. I have had my share of nightmares at auto body shops that not only jacked up the price but also took forever to fix my car. I have a Mercedes which I sometimes curse for the damge repair cost but I don't feel like Magic Touch Jacks up my cost for that reason. They have always honored their original estimate and above that cleaned my car and done more then expected which I would think is possibly just good luck 2 out of 3 times but 3 out of 3?... and after a lot more interaction and several other friends reviews confirming the same I am now convinced that this is the way they operate and I have personally confirmed that they genuinely seem to pay attention and care about honest work and long-term clientele. I cannot say enough good things about Magic Touch and if you see similar postings online it's because I am making it a point to post on as many review forums as I can. I only hope someone feeling overwhelmed with all the Auto Body Shops in Miami will have the opportunity of enjoying the great service this shop provides.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "\"Natdia\" was a Native American spiritual movement that came about in the late 1880s, when living conditions were deplorable on Indian reservations and the People needed something to give them hope. Central to the religion was the \"Ghost Dance\", which they believed would bring about the renewal of their society and the removal of the fork-tongued Whites. The Lakota Sioux took it one step further, making \"Ghost Shirts\" which they believed would protect them from the soldiers' bullets. Their great chief Sitting Bull was soon after killed by tribal police sent to stop the Ghost Dancing. Then at Wounded Knee South Dakota on 29 December 1890, the United States Cavalry fatally riddled the Ghost Shirts of more than 200 cold and starving Sioux warriors, women and children with thousands of rounds of hot lead, ending forever the Ghost Dancing and all hopes of returning to a once noble, free and natural existence.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "SummaryAcetylation of histone tails plays a key role in chromatin dynamics and is associated with the potential for gene expression. We show here that a 2–3 bp mispositioning of the nucleosome covering the TATA box at PHO5 induces a dependency on the acetylatable lysine residues of the histone H4 N-terminal region and on the TFIID-associated bromodomain factor Bdf1. This dependency arises either through fusion of the PHO5 promoter to a lacZ reporter or by mutation of the TATA box in the natural gene. The results suggest that promoters in which the TATA box is either absent or poorly accessible on the surface of a nucleosome may compensate by using Bdf1 bromodomains and acetylated H4 tails to anchor TFIID to the promoter during the initial stages of transcription activation. We propose that nucleosome positioning at the nucleotide level provides a subtle, but highly effective, mechanism for gene regulation.", "label": "clean"}
{"text": "Unlike Maggiano’s Little Italy, the Italian-American style chain of restaurants located in Oakbrook and in the River North neighborhood in Chicago, the food at Anteprima favors quality over quantity. They don’t serve heaping mounds of spaghetti and meatballs. Their portions are reasonably sized and well balanced. Several friends from Avelino, South of Rome, once dined in Maggiano’s, and were appalled by the size of the portions. Carmen, in her typical blunt-Italian style, gave the waitress the look and told her that the pig trough full of pasta in front of her wasn’t fit for animals. Once can expect to find pasta stuffed with herb ricotta and chard in asparagus butter sauce, ravioli spinach pasta filled with porcini and in mushroom cream sauce with pine nuts, tagliatelle with duck ragù and with prosciutto ragù, grilled octopus, wood-grilled whole fish, orecchiette with lamb sausage (my favorite), and balsamic and honey-laced quail. The pasta is homemade, the salumi is artisanal, and the olives and bread are top shelf. The dish that really sent me into rapture was the panzanella, a poor-man’s summer classic from Tuscany. The dish consists of a salad of chunks of soaked stale bread, pomodoro tomatoes, red onions, fresh basil and dressed with fruity olive oil and vinegar. The evening my wife and I dined, it was mid-summer and we chose to eat on the back porch of the restaurant. It was a lovely evening, and I’d recommend it to anyone.", "label": "clean"}

In the early 1960s, Lou Baney was general manager of a notable dealership in Downey, California, called Yeakel Chrysler/Plymouth. He and Vince Rossi convinced his boss, Bob Yeakel, to sponsor a Top Fuel dragster. Baney then hired Ed Pink to build the engines and employed the very talented John Garrison as crew chief. The Baney car was also one of the first to run the B&M Torkmaster automatic transmission. The Baney, Pink, McEwen combination proved to be very successful, and for the first time money became less of an obstacle for McEwen. During his relationship with Baney and Yeakel, McEwen ventured into a new class of drag racing called Factory Experimental (soon to become Funny Car) when he built a car sponsored by Yeakel called the Hemi ’Cuda. Somewhat ahead of its time, the handling was sensitive, and, at Long Beach, McEwen put the car on its roof—ending the experiment for the time being.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Studies show that many older adults who die by suicide — up to 75 percent — visited a physician within a month before death.30 These findings point to the urgency of improving detection and treatment of depression to reduce suicide risk among older adults. The risk of depression in the elderly increases with other illnesses and when ability to function becomes limited. For example, depression is associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease in older men and women.31 Depressive disorder is not a normal part of aging. Depression can and should be treated when it occurs at the same time as other medical illnesses. Untreated depression can delay recovery or worsen the outcome of these other illnesses. A review of the literature suggests that periodic screening at regular intervals, at least for people with risk factors, is widely recommended. For example, the USPSTF noted that people who are at greater risk for depression “are considered at risk throughout their lifetime.”32 Risk factors include family history of depression, female gender, and the presence of other psychiatric disorders or chronic disease.33 For example, a 2005 analysis concluded that depressive disorders are “associated with increased prevalence of chronic diseases,” which “appears attributable to depressive disorders precipitating chronic disease and to chronic disease exacerbating symptoms of depression.”34 Depression screening can be performed quickly, conveniently, and at low cost.35 Moreover, depression screening appears low-risk; the USPSTF did not find evidence that addressed risks or harms associated with depression screening in adults and elderly patients in primary care.36 Given all these circumstances, it would be prudent for Medicare to cover depression screening at least annually - - or more frequently if other circumstances (such as the presence of one or more of the risk factors noted above) suggest that more frequent screening is appropriate, though we recognize that providing more frequent screening could present challenges to the provider.", "label": "clean"}

Essentially this means any kind of learning that takes place outside the traditional classroom setting, like watching TV, attending a play, or (most importantly for me) visiting a museum. This type of learning is particularly powerful because it is driven by people’s interests. We are all free to choose when, where, and what to learn. Best of all, research shows that free-choice learning works best when people are having fun!", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Why do states delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to international organizations rather than acting unilaterally or cooperating directly? Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters.", "label": "clean"}

One Brazilian economist credits Bolsa Familia with 17 percent of the country’s reduction in inequality since 2001. “Pensions and other welfare payments had a similar effect, but at a massively higher cost.” In Mexico, as a result of Oportunidades, enrollment in rural high schools is up 85 percent. Mexico’s success with Oportunidades has inspired forty other countries to implement similar programs. One new NGO that I’m watching closely, GiveDirectly, is using census data to locate the poorest households in Kenya (80% of which report not having enough food for tomorrow), and using Safaricom’s M-Pesa mobile payments system to directly transfer money to them. GiveDirectly doesn’t tell recipients what to do with the money, but recipients so far report using it to buy food, livestock, and clothes, invest in their homes, and pay school fees. Surely the people in Annawadi would quickly figure out how to better their lives with such cash transfers. As The Economist suggests, perhaps once India issues national ID numbers to more of its citizens—proper documentation often determines whether poor people can access services, and India is leading a landmark identification effort—the country could be well-placed to create a robust cash transfer program of its own. I suspect that only through such a program will the all-important “infrastructure of opportunity” in India improve.", "label": "clean"}
{"text": "Though his methods are human, his legend has the evocative Southern Gothic tone of ancient curses and monstrous revenge. The child of rape, Leslie’s mother and stepfather abused him horribly, forcing him to sleep in the symbolically important cider room. Eventually, Leslie rebelled and killed them, hacking his stepfather up with a hand scythe and lynching his mother in the apple orchard. When the town discovered the crime, an angry mob threw him over a waterfall into an icy river. As Zelda Rubenstein explains in her malfunctioning babydoll voice: “That cold, bodies don’t come back up. Turtles picked his bones clean.” On the twentieth anniversary of his death, Leslie has returned to exact vengeance on the community. As the film matures, it is revealed that Leslie is not what he claims to be and has merely glommed onto the legend of Leslie Vernon as part of his bid to join the ranks of “Jay, Fred and Mike.”", "label": "clean"}

Thus, when liberals and progressives took control in 1868, one of their first priorities was educational reform. They declared, first of all, the principle of freedom of education and teaching. The instability and factionalism of the liberal regime, however, precluded any lasting reforms in education. The conservative return to power in 1874 reestablished the right of the State to dictate to schools the textbooks to be used and the curriculum to be followed. In addition, Orovio, the Minister in charge of education, sent out to the Directors (or Rectores) of the Universities a circular in which he recommended that no religious doctrines inimical to those held by the State be taught and that no political ideas be expressed to the detriment of the king's person or the constitutional monarchy then in power. The circular also stated that action would be taken against any professor who so indulges in such political or religious meditations -- i.e., expulsion from the University.

Is there really even an evolution, a progression, a growth out of one thing and into another? There is a part of me that feels that humans are different than the rest of nature, but how, really? Can what we see as peace and violence/destruction co-exist? Are they necessarily opposed to each other? Are we meant to evolve out of the base level of “survival of the fittest?” I think that I agree with the idea that what sets humans apart from a great deal of nature is the capacity for compassion.

{"text": "This study explored the nature of the relationship between cognitive moral development as defined by Lawrence Kohlberg and ego development as defined by Jane Loevinger. The effects of general cognitive development were controlled by the selection of subjects who were capable of formal operational thinking. Subjects were 120 Jewish volunteers comprised of equal numbers of junior high-school, senior high-school, and college students of both sexes. All subjects received three tests: A Screening Measure for Formal Operations, The Sentence Completion Test (SCT) which measures ego development, and The Moral Judgment Interview (MJI). Results indicated the existence of significant positive correlations between the SCT and MJI in the overall sample, in the total male and female samples, in the entire college group, and in the female college group. No significant correlations were found in the junior high-school and senior high-school groups, possibly due to restricted ranges of scores. In addition, most subjects at moral development stages 3/4 and above had attained at least the conscientious-conformist level. Results also indicated the presence of differences between male and female scores. The correlations for females were consistently higher than for males, females scored significantly higher on the SCT, males scored significantly higher on the MJI, and the relationship between specific moral and ego development stages seemed to be stronger for females than for males. The differences found in this study between the sexes in performance on the MJI are consistent with Gilligan's theory about the distinctions between male and female approaches to moral dilemmas. However, that theory was found to be inadequate in explaining the stronger relationship between MJI and SCT scores manifested by the females in this study. The SCT was criticized for not specifying clearly the ego development features that it measured. It was suggested that the exact nature of the interplay between moral and ego development could be illuminated more fully by research that focused on specific well-defined features of ego development. ^", "label": "clean"}

The States' interest in controlling land-use development and in exploring all the ramifications of challenge to a zoning restriction should command the same deference from the federal judiciary. See Williamson, 473 U.S., at 194 -197. And our interest in avoiding the decision of federal constitutional questions on anything less than a fully informed basis counsels against trying to decide whether equitable relief has forestalled a temporary taking until after we know what the relief is. In short, even if the California courts adhere to a rule of never granting monetary relief for a temporary regulatory taking, I believe we should require the property owner to exhaust his state remedies before confronting the question whether the net result of the state proceedings has amounted to a temporary taking of property without just compensation. In this case, the Church should be required to pursue an action demanding invalidation of the ordinance prior to seeking this Court's review of California's procedures. 16 [482 U.S. 304, 339]", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "One night, preaching in my own church in Minneapolis, the whole choir stayed for the after-meeting. The leading soprano was an intelligent young woman, but she was living a worldly life. She remained with the rest. In the after-meeting, her mother arose in the back of the church and said, \"I wish you would pray for the conversion of my daughter.\" I did not look around but knew instinctively that her cheeks were flushing, and her eyes were flashing with anger. As soon as the meeting was dismissed, I hurried down so that I would meet her before she got out of the church. As she came toward me I held out my hand to her. She stamped her foot, and with flashing eyes cried, \"Mr. Torrey, my mother knows better than to do that. She knows it will only make me worse.\" I said, \"Sit down, Cora.\" She sat down, and without any argument I opened my Bible to Isaiah 53:5, and began to read, \"But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\" She burst into tears, and the next night accepted Jesus Christ. I had to go to Duluth for a few days, and when I returned I found that she was seriously ill. One morning her brother came hurrying up to my home and said that she was apparently dying, that she was unconscious and white from the loss of blood. I hastened down. As I entered the room, she lay there with her eyes closed, with the whitest face I ever saw on one who was not actually dead. She was apparently unconscious, scarcely breathing. I knelt by her side to pray, more for the sake of the mother who stood beside the bed than for her, for I supposed that she was beyond help or hearing. But no sooner had I finished my prayer, than in a clear, full, richly musical tone she began to pray. These were about her words, \"Heavenly Father, if it be Thy will, raise me up that as I have used my voice for myself and only to please myself, I may use my voice for Thy glory, but if in Thy wisdom Thou seest that it is best for me not to live, I shall be glad to go to be with Christ,\" and she went to be with Christ. Oh, I have seen thousands melted as I have repeated to them and shown them the picture of Christ on the cross, as told in Isaiah 53:5, \"But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\"", "label": "clean"}

Ionic channels are thought to play a central role in this modulation but the precise relationship between their properties and the threshold is unclear. We examined this relationship in biophysical models and derived a formula which quantifies the contribution of various mechanisms. The originality of our approach is that it provides an instantaneous time-varying value for the threshold, which applies to the highly fluctuating regimes characterizing neurons in vivo. In particular, two known ionic mechanisms were found to make the threshold adapt to the membrane potential, thus providing the cell with a form of gain control.", "label": "clean"}

The effectiveness of policosanol is still questionable but it has been approved as a cholesterol-lowering drug in over 25 countries (Carbajal D et al., Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent Fatty Acids 1998, 58, 61), and it is sold as a lipid-lowering supplement in more than 40 countries. More recent studies in mice question about any action on improvement of lipoprotein profiles (Dullens SPJ et al., J Lipid Res 2008, 49, 790). The authors conclude that individual policosanols, as well as natural policosanol mixtures, have no potential for reducing coronary heart disease risk through effects on serum lipoprotein concentrations. Furthermore, sugar cane policosanol at doses of 20 mg daily has shown no lipid lowering effects in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia (Francini-Pesenti F et al., Phytother Res 2008, 22, 318). It must be noticed that, for the most part, positive results have been obtained by only one research group in Cuba. Outside Cuba, all groups have failed to validate the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of policosanols (Marinangeli C et al., Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr 2010, 50, 259).

{"text": "AbstractIn this paper, I seek to understand the behavioral basis of higher organizational learning and adaption as a teleological dynamic equilibrium process to decipher the underlying psycho-physiological aspects of individual cognitive learning related to organizational adaption. Dynamics of cognitive learning has some differential paths within the neural circuitry which follows certain patterns that leads to individual as well as organized evolution in course of a learning process. I undertake a comparative analysis of human cognitive and behavioral changes and the active mechanisms underlying animal behavior and learning processes to understand the differential patterns of these adaptive changes in these two species. Cognitive behavioral learning processes have certain economic perspectives which help an individual to attain efficiency in workplace adaptation and in learning which however, the individual when being part of an alliance, ember positive influence on the society or organization as a whole. Comparatively, in primates, I review some empirical evidences drawn from chronological studies about cognitive behavioral learning process and adaptation as well as the presence of the capacity of making attributions about mental states, which exists in rudimentary form in chimpanzees and apes. Following this, I apply the outcomes of the findings on different aspects of human cognitive and adaptive behavioral learning-induced evolutionary changes and how human beings are able to exploit the presence of these additive advantages under cluster settings.", "label": "clean"}

If they don’t, they won’t recognize your destination, the 360-degree Jesus, so they are likely to direct you right back to Nice Girl City.

For that matter, there may also be longtime allies that find themselves at odds with major multilateral organizations, as the Honduran transitional government recently has, in which case Washington may end up siding with the latter as part of its regional or global “leadership” role.

In college, I was a waiter at a Hilton hotel and showed up very late for work several times in a row due to school obligations.

She had dealt with many college students before: stressed out, living from paycheck to paycheck, struggling to make it on their own. I can’t remember the exact words she used, but I do remember how she didn’t belittle or shame me. She didn’t brush my tardiness under the rug, nor did she rub my nose in it. Instead, she did an outstanding job of making my tardiness the problem—not me—and she used the meeting to show me that she cared about my larger dreams and aspirations. I walked out of her office thinking, “This is very strange. I should feel hurt after being corrected by someone. But instead I feel…good.” I was blessed by this rebuke from one of God’s Good Women who knew she could treat others well as she advanced up the company ladder.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Notable causeways include those that connect Singapore and Malaysia (the Johor–Singapore Causeway), Bahrain and Saudi Arabia (25-km long King Fahd Causeway) and Venice to the mainland, all of which carry roadways and railways. In the Netherlands there are a number of prominent dykes which also double as causeways, including the Afsluitdijk, Brouwersdam, and Markerwaarddijk. In Louisiana, two very long bridges, called the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, stretch across Lake Pontchartrain for almost 38 km, making them the world's longest bridges (if total length is considered instead of span length). They are also the oldest causeways on the Gulf Coast that have never been put out of commission for an extended period of time following a hurricane. In the Republic of Panama a causeway connects the islands of Perico, Flamenco, and Naos to Panama City on the mainland. It also serves as a breakwater for ships entering the Panama Canal. Its English name causeway is sometimes confused with \"Coastway\", name of a touristic zone in Panama city. The Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan had causeways supporting roads and aqueducts. The oldest engineered road yet discovered is the Sweet Track in England, dating from the 3800s BC.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "It's easy to make a high oxidation state in an anion because an anion is electron-rich. The electronegativity is lower for a given oxidation state in an anion than it is in a neutral molecule. That in turn, is lower than it is in a cation. If I take silver and I expose it to fluorine in the presence of fluoride ion, in HF, and expose it to light to break of F2 to atoms, I convert the silver to silver(III), AgF4-. This is easy because the AG(III) is in an anion. I can then pass in boron trifluoride and precipitate silver trifluoride, which is now a much more potent oxidizer than AgF4- because the electronegativity in the neutral AgF3 is much higher than it is in the anion. If I can now take away a fluoride ion, and make a cation, I drive the electronegativity even further up. With such a cation, for example, AgF2+, I can steal the electron from PtF6- and make PtF6.... This is an oxidation that even Kr(II) is unable to bring about.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Some paths attempt to steer us along a more ascetic path of renunciation, but I believe this is more because they simply feel that we are not strong enough to take the other path -- the path of initiation and moksha within the world, whether through the \"blissful participation in the sorrows of the world\" of a Bodhi-Satva path, the extremism of the Aghori's, or really any other path which allows an individual to attain liberation from the world while remaining within it. This smacks somewhat of the Zen koan, \"How do you get the goose out of the bottle?\" (An example of this can be found in The Book of Serenity, translated by Thomas Cleary, Lindisfarne 1990, case 91: \"Nanquan's Peony.\" However, it is an oft repeated koan.) How can we be liberated from the elements of participation in the world that bind us to it, without simply renouncing it? A question worthy of consideration, and one that is more connected to initiation than most might at first assume -- but certainly not a question that can be answered in an essay!", "label": "clean"}

This article reports upon an empirical study of readers’ responses to a range of interactive fictions, a study which aimed to uncover in detail the key factors affecting readers’ experience of this narrative form. On the basis of the study’s findings, it is argued that interactive fiction can offer an enjoyable reading experience, if core issues around narrative structure and interface design are addressed by writers.

(Earlier, my husband, I and Mr. Harmon, arranged an intervention after which Curtis left CSI.) Eugene Ingram, a CSI P.I., told Curtis that unless Curtis agreed to be deposed, he would lose his relationship with his Scientology mother. So Curtis went through ten hours of video deposition in which he was asked the same questions repeatedly. Afterwards, he was given an affidavit, attached hereto as Exhibit 47, which drafted and typed for Curtis' signature. It contained statements contrary to those he said in the deposition, but, because he was exhausted and afraid of losing his mother, he signed. On the 23rd March, Curtis wrote a second affidavit in Seattle to correct the first, attached hereto as Exhibit 48, stating, \"... I was asked the same question over and over in many different ways until I agreed to one small part of what they were talking about, but then it would be twisted to fit what they wanted to hear. Even when I would say I didn't really remember or didn't really know for sure, it would end up in the Affidavit anyway.\" (C. Harmon affidavit of March 23, 1993, page 1).", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Collaborative investigative efforts of officials in many local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies linked this outbreak to Marie Callender’s Cheesy Chicken & Rice single-serve frozen entrées. During June 14-18, 2010, CDC and public health officials in multiple states conducted an epidemiologic study by comparing foods eaten by 19 ill and 22 well persons. Analysis of this study suggested that eating a Marie Callender's frozen meal was a source of illness. Ill persons (89%) were significantly more likely than well persons (14%) to report eating a frozen meal. All ill persons (100%) who ate frozen meals reported eating a Marie Callender's frozen meal. None of the well persons who ate a frozen meal reported eating a Marie Callender's frozen meal. There was insufficient data from this study to implicate a specific frozen meal type. However, many of the ill persons reported eating a Marie Callender's Cheesy Chicken & Rice frozen entrée in the week before becoming ill. Additionally, two unopened packages of Marie Callender’s Cheesy Chicken & Rice single-serve frozen entrées collected from two patients’ homes (one collected in Minnesota on June 18, and one in Tennessee on July 19) yielded Salmonella Chester isolates with a genetic fingerprint indistinguishable from the outbreak pattern.", "label": "clean"}

Albrecht’s idealized stratocumulus cloud, which he argues is typical, has a thickness of 375 m, a drizzle rate of 1 mm per day, and a mean droplet radius of 100 mm, and he assumes that each droplet is formed by the coalescence of 1000 smaller droplets. The rate at which the CCN are depleted by his model is 1000/cm3 per day. Consequently, about 300/cm3 per day (30 percent of 1000) of additional CCN would have to be discharged per day at the base of the cloud to maintain a 4 percent increase in cloudiness. This assumes that the perturbed atmosphere would also remain sufficiently close to saturation in the vicinity of the CCN that additional cloud cover would be formed every time the number of CCN increased.”", "label": "clean"}

It is called the filling of the Spirit. Now let me add something and I want to talk about this for a moment because it's important. This baptism that occurs in verse 2 is not experiential.

Much of the Asian side of the Bosphorus functions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in European Istanbul, accounting for a third of the city's population but only a quarter of its employment. As a result of Istanbul's exponential growth during the 20th century, a significant portion of the city is composed of gecekondular (literally \"built overnight\"), referring to illegally constructed squatter buildings.

{"text": "Pacemakers may operate in different response modes, such as asynchronous (fixed rate), inhibited (stimulus generated in absence of specified cardiac activity), or triggered (stimulus delivered in presence of specified cardiac activity). Further, present-day pacers range from the simple fixed rate device that offers pacing with no sensing (of cardiac activity) function, to fully automatic dual chamber pacing and sensing functions (so-called DDD pacemakers) which may provide a degree of physiologic pacing by at least a slight adjustment of heart rate according to varying metabolic conditions in a manner akin to the natural pacing of the heart. Thus, some DDD pacemaker patients experience an increased pacing rate with physical exertion, with concomitantly higher cardiac output, and thereby, an ability to handle low levels of exercise. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of the pacemaker patient population, who suffer from atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or sick-sinus syndrome, for example, cannot obtain the benefit of exercise-responsive pacing with conventional atrial-triggered pacemakers. Moreover, the DDD-type pacemakers are complex and costly to manufacture, which is reflected in a higher price to the patient.", "label": "clean"}

Early renewal came a day after ABC picked up its signature comedies for fall. “‘Raising Hope’ has emerged as a comedic standout: wickedly smart, hilarious and full of heart,” said Fox Entertainment prexy Kevin Reilly. Greg Garcia created and exec produces “Hope,” which comes from 20th Century Fox TV. Lucas Neff, Martha Plimpton, Garret Dillahunt, Shannon Woodward and Cloris Leachman star. Also on Tuesday, Fox kicked off its portion of the TV Critics Assn. press tour by announcing — as expected — a firm “preview” date for new epic prehistoric series “Terra Nova.” Show will get a two-night launch on Monday, May 23 at 9 p.m. and Tuesday, May 24 at 9 p.m. (behind the penultimate “American Idol”). The show then returns officially in the fall (following a similar air pattern to the launch of “Glee” in 2009). And the network announced that its new sketch comedy series from Jamie Foxx, along with comedian Affion Crockett, will get a sneak preview on Thursday, March 31 at 9 p.m., behind “Idol.” Show will regularly air this summer on Thursdays at 9 p.m. starting June 9. The as-yet untitled show comes from Fox TV Studios, Foxx/King Ent. and Tanatmount. Foxx, Todd Yasui, Marcus King, Jaime Rucker King, Eric Tannenbaum, Kim Tannenbaum and Mitch Hurwitz are exec producers. Also, Fox announced that former “So You Think You Can Dance” judge Mary Murphy will return to the show, along side Nigel Lythgoe, this summer.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Why do CRM initiatives fail so often? We have spent the last ten years trying to answer this, analyzing customer-loyalty initiatives, both successful and unsuccessful, at more than 200 companies in a wide range of industries. Our research suggests that one reason CRM backfires is that most executives simply don’t understand what they are implementing, let alone how much it costs or how long it will take. If you find that hard to believe, try asking five of your managers to define CRM. The right answer: CRM aligns business processes with customer strategies to build customer loyalty and increase profits over time. (Note that the words “technology” and “software” are conspicuously absent from the definition.) Then try quizzing these same managers about the cost of implementing a CRM solution. Answer: $60 million to $130 million, according to Forrester Research. And finally, ask them how long it generally takes to implement CRM. The best estimate: at least 24 months, even though one vendor we know offers CRM in 90 days and an aggressive competitor has responded by promising it in only nine.", "label": "clean"}

Wisconsin's codification of the attorney-client privilege protects the confidentiality of clients' communications with counsel. Beam, however, alleges that IPCO objected not to the confidential nature of Beam's relationship but to the existence of the relationship. Even under Wandry, the connection between the purpose of the privilege and Beam's injury is too attenuated to meet the \"clear and compelling\" standard. In sum, we do not believe that any of the provisions identified by Beam reflect a clear and compelling policy against an employer's firing an employee for consulting an attorney about an employment dispute.", "label": "clean"}

In the 3-0 victory, he struck out 12 and issued three walks.\"Amos Otis was the last out, and Amos and I had been teammates, so I knew him pretty well,\" Ryan said. \"He hit a long fly ball to right-center for the out. In that ballpark, that's a good place, because when people hit the ball in the air, there's a good chance you'll get him out.\" Right fielder Ken Berry made the catch; he'd replaced Bob Oliver, who had homered, defensively in the seventh inning. Others of note in the Angels' lineup that day were designated hitter Frank Robinson, one of Ryan's fellow Hall of Famers, and center fielder Bobby Valentine, now the Red Sox's manager. The Royals' lineup included manager-to-be Lou Piniella in left field and first baseman John Mayberry, who struck out in all three at-bats against Ryan. That day also happened to be George Brett's 20th birthday -- he turned 59 on Tuesday -- but at that time, he was still in the Minors. Brett debuted with Kansas City later that year on Aug. 2, and he and Ryan would retire on the same day as the 1993 season ended at old Arlington Stadium. \"I never viewed myself as a no-hit pitcher and I had no reason to think I'd ever be in that position again. So it was the start of a very interesting period in my career,\" Ryan said. Two months later, on July 15, 1973, Ryan no-hit the Tigers at Detroit and would pitch five more no-hitters in his career.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "I have a question on exactly how much owners are dishing out for their respective teams. I realize that to buy a team costs an incredible amount of money, but where does that money go? (I'm guessing it's to the previous owner, but I'm not positive). And once an owner actually purchases a team, do they invest any more money in player salaries, etc.? What exactly is the owner's role financially after purchasing a team? The money goes to the old owner in full or in pieces, depending on the agreement. Most of the time these days, people barrow heavily to buy the team and then service the debt while the equity grows. Just like an interest-only mortgage, eh, Mr. Gilbert? But the NBA requires a significant percentage of cash be brought to the table as well. Then, yes, they must pay for everything including player salaries, etc., etc. Often the operating money for the team comes from the arena, which most teams get the revenue from. The Cavs lost money for years, but the Gund Arena Company made money on concerts and other events. The lease Gilbert got when he bought the Cavs is as valuable as owning the arena outright. Teams without arena deals just don't sell, which is why the Philadelphia 76ers and Portland Trail Blazers couldn't sell last year. Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen has since bought the arena, no word on whether Philly owner Comcast would be willing to give up control of the Wachovia Center, before they were not and therefore the Sixers did not sell and were taken off the market.", "label": "clean"}

So many of us were indoctrinated with a religious or political worldview as children and want nothing more than to avoid indoctrination in our own families. So what should the goal be? Are we trying to raise a flock of miniature James Randi clones? Do we want to tell our children what skepticism says the world is or, as Jeff Wagg, communications director for the James Randi Educational Foundation, says, accept that “the process teaches kids to think about things.” Critical thinking and science are tools to learn about the world, and teaching our children to correctly use these tools will help them not only to understand the true nature of the world but be the innovators and visionaries of the next generation.", "label": "clean"}

The Germans stared speculating about improved eyesight of the British during WW2 during air raids, since the British populace ate lots of carrots. This was not accurate because of carrots but rather for the multiple radar stations. It is true that lack of vitamin A causes night blindness so eating a carrot every couple of weeks can be beneficial. Most of the carrot's nutrients are found in the outside wall. To preserve this, eat them freshly washed. If that turns you off, take a sharp knife and scrape away a thin layer. Only peel really thick carrots.", "label": "clean"}

The Pentagon bowed to pressure early last year by allowing women troops to serve in non-combat roles as part of battalions, which put them closer to the front lines. More than one poll has showed majority support for letting women serve in combat, and other allied militaries, like Australia and the IDF, already make some combat roles available to women. The question wasn’t whether this might happen, it’s how broad the new policy would end up being. Volunteers only or mandatory service for all women who are fit to serve on the front lines? Special Ops duties too or are the physical requirements too onerous? Israel has already lowered its standards for female combat troops, although allegedly that has less to do with physical challenges than with women wanting to serve in more tech-heavy roles.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "The reproducibility of conventional two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis can be improved using differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE), a new emerging technology for proteomic analysis. In DIGE, two pools of proteins are labeled with 1-(5-carboxypentyl)-1'-propylindocarbocyanine halide (Cy3) N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester and 1-(5-carboxypentyl)-1'-methylindodi-carbocyanine halide (Cy5) N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester fluorescent dyes, respectively. The labeled proteins are mixed and separated in the same 2D gel. 2D DIGE was applied to quantify the differences in protein expression between laser capture microdissection-procured esophageal carcinoma cells and normal epithelial cells and to define cancer-specific and normal-specific protein markers. Analysis of the 2D images from protein lysates of approximately 250,000 cancer cells and normal cells identified 1038 protein spots in cancer cell lysates and 1088 protein spots in normal cell lysates. Of the detected proteins, 58 spots were up-regulated by >3-fold and 107 were down-regulated by >3-fold in cancer cells. In addition to previously identified down-regulated protein annexin I, tumor rejection antigen (gp96) was found up-regulated in esophageal squamous cell cancer. Global quantification of protein expression between laser capture-microdissected patient-matched cancer cells and normal cells using 2D DIGE in combination with mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for the molecular characterization of cancer progression and identification of cancer-specific protein markers.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "In these passages King Benjamin is concerned with those who have already “been taught” concerning the truth (Mosiah 2:34) and then have turned away, coming out in “open rebellion against God” (Mosiah 2:37). He is not speaking of those who died without the opportunity to hear the Gospel, as Wilson implies. In the following chapter, Benjamin goes on to say that the blood of Christ atones for the sins of those “who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned” (Mosiah 3:11). The only way for anyone to be saved is through the atonement and “there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men” (Mosiah 3:17). Benjamin also indicates that “the time shall come when a knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue and people” (Mosiah 3:21). Since he has just mentioned those who “died not knowing the will of God concerning them” this passage suggests that the time would eventually come when they too would hear that message. “And, behold, when that time cometh, none shall be found blameless before God, except it be little children, only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent” (Mosiah 3:22). Contrary to Wilson, this passage is consistent with the LDS teaching.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "I started practicing the Dayton Method Hot Yoga on January 8th 2012. 5 days after I started, I started the 30 day challenge, and then continued into the 60 day challenge, only I call it my “60 day transformation.” By all odds, I never should have started this. I have heard about hot yoga from time to time and always immediately ruled it out using self-talk like “I’m too old, I’m injured, too fat, too out of shape and especially I hate heat.” I had some serious injuries, shattered my shoulder requiring plates and screws 1 ½ yrs ago, neck surgery and knee surgery. This caused me to not be able to exercise to the point of cracking a sweat in almost 2 years, which resulted in feeling tired all the time and depressed. I read that it would be good to use a sauna to at least get heart rate variability if you “can’t exercise,” and began thinking, “Why go into a sauna and just sit down? Maybe trying this hot yoga would be better.” So. . . having never done any kind of yoga and feeling somewhat intimidated, I just walked in, plunked down 20 bucks, thinking that even if I only last 5 minutes in there, it would be O.K., at least I tried it. I had been on-line to read about studios, and choose Hot Yoga Dayton Method studio even though there are many closer to my home after seeing the nice website and then reading someone’s comment that he “likes it that Jason is a clean freak;” this last statement brought me in, and I’m so thankful that I found this particular studio. Physically: I am still rehabilitating my shoulder, knee, and neck, and have had more progress with these in the last 3 months doing Hot Yoga than I had in the previous 1 ½ years. My entire body is stronger, more flexible, and limber. My favorite pose is Triangle because it is SO HARD and yet, I can do it. I’m just amazed every time. During the hold, I literally can feel every muscle in my body and legs getting stronger. I am 57 years old, and was starting to feel and move “likes an old lady,” and now I feel like I’ve discovered the Fountain of Youth. . . I feel like I did 20+ years ago; I am not exaggerating here! I have been “eating clean” and the yoga causes me to not want to eat things that make you feel bogged down, resulting in 27 lb weight loss so far. I teach at the College, and even after only about 3 weeks of continuous yoga practice, I could feel a difference when standing in front of a classroom, I could feel my strong legs and posture. I also feel much less stressed, at all times. I think the Yoga releases stress from my body and also create a mindfulness to stay in the relaxed mode. I realized it the 1st session when laying prone in Savasana and Jason said “put left (or right) ear to mat” and I could! (Hadn’t been able to since the injury and neck surgery). . . I realized right then and there the value of the heat in increasing the suppleness of the muscles. I walked right out and signed up for the upcoming 30 day challenge.I know that your thoughts create your experience; sometimes it’s easy to forget to walk the talk. As soon as I quit telling myself that I couldn’t possibly do this, that I hate heat etc., and just came in with an open and curious mind, a whole new world opened up for me. I even found that: Yes, I can too stand on my knees, or grab my feet from behind, and eventually move into postures that I never in a million years would have thought I would be doing. I am so honored to be selected for the May student of the month. It is my hope that some of what I said might encourage or inspire someone, as I have received so much encouragement and inspiration from the staff and clientele at HBHY.I am thankful to have found hot yoga and especially this studio. It really has changed my life. If you are new to this, my advice is to show up often, and trust the process. I’m so excited about it, I could scream!", "label": "clean"}

On the plus side, there is now a greater involvement of local scientists in glacier monitoring activities, as opposed to the dominant involvement of experts from the central institutions in Moscow or Tashkent. On the downside, the growing autonomy of countries within Central Asia has led to a diverse array of glacier monitoring and assessment methodologies and a subsequent lack of regional coordination and compatibility. In an attempt to overcome this problem, the long-standing glacier monitoring center in Kazakhstan, in collaboration with UNESCO, is starting to hold regional glacier-focused conferences to encourage better regional coordination.

{"text": "April20 @ @ RandyP comments: mypad:FaithOfJesuskjv@Matthew:27:11-26 WHETHER OF THE TWAIN - One man washes his hands of the blood guilt and the others pour it on to their heads of themselves and their children. Blood by both is made lite of. One cannot be innocent of the blood simply by washing their hands of the matter. The fact is that matters were poorly and unjustly handled in the first place. Pilate proved coward to the pressures of the Sanhedrin. Others cannot take such minute opinion of any man's life so as to not guarantee a safe and judicious proceedings, so as to not be driven by impulse or shrewd coercion. After all Jesus had done to reveal the sinful hypocrisy and false teaching and spiritual callous blindness of the Pharisees/the Sadducee/the Scribes the make up the Sanhedrin, for the general public to be so easily intimidated and manipulated is a sin equal to that of Judas even if this had not been Christ. What then of the evidences in favor, the many and daily healings, the exorcisms, the wondrous and picturesque sermons, the miracles, the possible ties to long held prophecy, the hope of Israel? Were these possibilities no factor to them at all? The blood stains of guilt cannot be washed away. The price of guilt cannot be negotiated by the guilty parties involved. Jesus' blood is meant to redeem but, if it is not accepted as such it becomes a terrible pronouncement of guilt; guilt then, guilt today. There is a notorious thief that is given amnesty by us even at this hour. He is the embodiment of our being so easily turned and manipulated and used as a driving wedge between justice and those that must judge. Perhaps the greatest revelation of our hearts by Jesus was taught without a word. The faith of our Lord is not in the present but, in the future. It is a future ripped free from the clutches of man's continuous evil imagination and heart that is deceptive above all else.

Twenty-four birds are mainly found on the mountain and one, the Bornean Spiderhunter, is a pure endemic. The mountain is home to some 100 mammalian species mostly living high in the trees, including one of the four great apes, the orangutan (though sightings of these are uncommon; estimates of its numbers in the park range from 25 to 120). Other mammals include three kinds of deer, the Malayan Weasel (Mustela nudipes), Oriental Small-clawed Otter (Aonyx cinerea), and Leopard Cat (Felis bengalensis).

WWUH stayed on the air throughout, staffed by three volunteers, Allison Rasmussen, Mark Smith and John Ramsey, who were literally snowed into the Gengras Student Union for three days. The snowdrifts were up to the second story windows. For the first twelve hours or so, the volunteers thoroughly enjoyed the experience of having the radio station all to themselves. However, sometime in the second day of the event, two things happened: First, they realized that they were unable to leave the building because none of the outside doors could be opened because of the snow drifted up three to four feet high in front of them! Luckily, none of them had claustrophobia. Second, they ran out of money. They had been eating out of the vending machines on the first floor of Gengras, which at that time consisted of a number of machines that dispensed all sorts of goodies. There was a machine that dispensed candy, another soft drinks, another for ice cream, a fourth coffee and another for things like hot dogs, tuna sandwiches and even microwave popcorn (which had recently made its debut in the consumer marketplace). The food that the volunteers consumed from these machines while they were trapped in the building while certainly not nutritionally redeeming but it kept the hunger pangs away and probably provided the caffeine and energy necessary to operate the station hour after hour. Public Safety came to the station's aid by ferrying in food to our volunteers, who produced over 72 hours of programming between the three of them.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "\"My idea of village swaraj is that it is a complete republic, independent of its neighbours for its own vital wants, and yet interdependent for many others in which dependence is a necessity. Thus every village's first concern will be to grow its own food crops and cotton for its cloth. It should have a reserve for its cattle, recreation and playground for adults and children. Then if there is more land available, it will grow useful money crops, thus excluding ganja, tobacco, opium and the like. The village will maintain a village theatre, school and public hall. It will have its own waterworks, ensuring clean water supply. This can be done through controlled wells or tanks. Education will be compulsory up to the final basic course. As far as possible every activity will be conducted on the co-operative basis. There will be no castes such as we have today with their graded untouchability. Non-violence with its technique of satyagraha and non-co-operation will be the sanction of the village community. There will be a compulsory service of village guards who will be selected by rotation from the register maintained by the village. The government of the village will be conducted by a Panchayat of five persons annually elected by the adult villagers, male and female, possessing minimum prescribed qualifications. These will have all the authority and jurisdiction required. Since there will be no system of punishments in the accepted sense, this Panchayat will be the legislature, judiciary and executive combined to operate for its year of office. Any village can become such a republic today without much interference even from the present Government whose sole effective connection with the villages is the exaction of the village revenue. I have not examined here the question of relations with the neighbouring villages and the centre if any. My purpose is to present an outline of village government. Here there is perfect democracy based upon individual freedom. The individual is the architect of his own government. The law of non-violence rules him and his government. He and his village are able to defy the might of a world. For the law governing every villager is that he will suffer death in the defence of his and his village's honour.", "label": "clean"}

Leadership at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) expressed a desire to better understand accreditation as a quality improvement process and its implications for the city of Philadelphia. PURPOSE: This project investigated the history and process of accreditation for local health departments through a comprehensive literature review and an assessment of PDPH’s readiness to become accredited in the national program. METHODS: The Local Health Department Self-Assessment Tool (LHDSAT) was administered between January-March 2010 to 15 PDPH personnel using non-probability sampling methodology. Average scores for each indicator, standard and Essential Service were obtained, except for sections that only had one respondent. RESULTS: Overall score of PDPH’s capacity to fulfill all Ten Essential Services was reported at 2.60, indicating “moderate capacity.” PDPH demonstrated highest capacities in ES II and ES VI, lowest in ES-VIII and ES-IX. Out of 225 indicators, 33 scored at “minimal", "label": "clean"}

At the time the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, had been appointed Minister with responsibility for European affairs. It was not an easy brief and he had a more difficult ministerial portfolio than many of his Cabinet colleagues. I believe he ended up in Cabinet as a result of that ratification. Who knows but that political good fortune may be around the corner for him again. That kind of political competence and ministerial ability is needed to push this through. There is a lot at stake but we must ensure the Lisbon reform treaty is not rejected for the wrong reasons. We must banish the myths and put these lies to bed. We must also ensure there is proper, reasoned debate based on facts. I have no doubt that is the case but it is important to reiterate the arguments all the time. For example, an MEP on “Morning Ireland” this morning was continually interrupted by an opponent of the treaty. If that continues it will paint a picture to the reasonable thinking person of those who are against the treaty. For a variety of good reasons we need to ratify the treaty.", "label": "clean"}

Defenders claim that there is nothing Gestapo-like about this provision because immigrants are already required by federal law to carry their papers. What's more, they note, this law won't mean that cops will simply be able to stop anyone on the street and demand proof of legality. Interestingly, they made the same claim about the original law even though it required police officers to make little more than eye contact before launching a full-blown inquiry into someone's immigration status.", "label": "clean"}

This work was initiated in January 1947 under the initial guidance of Professors Knapp and Hollander. It has subsequently been continued by additional amendments to the original contract up to the present. The over-all objectives of this program were to make detailed observations and measurements of the internal flow in rotating impellers and stationary diffusors to permit the establishment of accurate design procedures for hydraulic machinery, and to serve as a starting point for realistic mathematical analysis of such flows. It is the intention of this report to indicate the scope of the work done under this contract and to describe the facilities built for its experimental end. A further aim is to outline, in brief, the reports and publications issued and some incidental benefits derived from this project.", "label": "clean"}

Many of the region?s 220 000 residents resorted to wood fuel for their heating and cooking needs during the winter, resulting in the decimation of local forests. The AKFED, in partnership with the International Finance Corporation, formed the PamirEnergy Company in 2002 to address the situation. Over US$ 30 million has since been invested by the company to repair the electrical infrastructure of the province and to expand hydroelectric capacity. In the wake of these efforts, almost 90 per cent of the region?s inhabitants now have access to electricity while tariff subsidies have ensured that even the poorest households are able to access power.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "On a less sarcastic note; What I see most people on these board advocate is not soft-balling or lack of respect for player maturity. What is being touted as a Good Thing(tm) is being able to adapt, adjust and generally create a fun experience. This can mean being less than 100% cutthroat effective with your monsters, or it can mean trying to be 110% deadly. It can be choosing not to recharge that burst 3 stun power, it can mean making a paralyze attack into a minor rather than a standard. It can be a lot of things. It depends on reading the players, the situation, the adventure, etc. etc. In my experience it is fairly complicated and almost impossible to define. Still it is generally held by your \"most people\" to be something to strive for.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "On the street side, the façade’s main feature is a double-height terrace leading off the living room and bringing more light into the first and second levels. The terrace windows, like the others, have opening panels 75 centimetres wide and fixed panels of different lengths. Bronze-coloured reflective glass punctuates the northfacing windows and echoes the dark brown brass fittings. Brass has been widely used throughout: 10 centimetre thick brass frames, standing slightly proud of the façade, surround the windows; the frame of the terrace with its sloping front juts out over the pavement. The use of a double front door means that it has been possible to build it seamlessly into the concrete façade. The rest of the ground level is designed in a completely different way, reflecting its intended use. A long window, reminiscent of early twentieth century Parisian workshops, is set back from the façade. The roof terrace has an oblique triangular ‘fin’ that offsets the rectangular outline of the streetside façade and gives the building a tapered effect.", "label": "clean"}

The living standards and wealth of Muslim nations will increase, and their existing inequalities will disappear. Some free trade agreements are already in place between countries in the Gulf, the Pacific Rim, and North Africa. Trade agreements signed by Turkey are already operational in the Islamic world. Bilateral cooperation exists in some regions; however, their scope must be widened. Such cooperation will safeguard the rights and interests of all Muslim nations and lead to all of them becoming developed—a result from which all of them will derive a far greater benefit than if they do not cooperate with each other.", "label": "clean"}

As a symbol it was every bit as threatening, as palpable an embodiment of federal power, as a sovereign Supreme Court. As part of a last-ditch campaign to scuttle the bank, the three Virginians within Washington’s official family mobilized to attack it on constitutional grounds. Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph submitted separate briefs, all arguing that the power to create a corporation was nowhere specified by the Constitution and that the Tenth Amendment clearly stated that powers not granted to the federal government were retained by the states. Before rendering his own verdict, Washington sent the three negative opinions to Hamilton for rebuttal. His response, which exceeded 13,000 words, became a landmark in American legal history, arguing that the “necessary and proper” clause of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 8) granted implied powers to the federal government beyond the explicit powers specified in the document. Though there is some evidence that Washington was wavering before Hamilton delivered his opinion, it was not the brilliance of the opinion that persuaded him. Rather, it provided the legal rationale he needed to do what he had always wanted to do. For the truth was that Washington was just as much an economic nationalist as Hamilton, a fact that Hamilton’s virtuoso leadership throughout the yearlong debate had conveniently obscured.", "label": "clean"}

That’s not going to happen. A more reliable study from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast that the bill would cost the average U.S. household $175 in higher energy costs annually by 2020 — and other studies estimate that the energy-efficiency provisions in the bill might even save Americans money over time.", "label": "clean"}

It appears to revolve around the judgment that He intends to shew to the Gentiles and the plots that are beginning to solidify from the Jewish leaders. Israel and His covenant to them remains in His heart but, not everything He does is strictly for Israel. In a sense Israel will have to come around in the future to this understanding of revelation and in great measure the Gentile nations will be used to drive them to this conclusion. For now, everything He does, every act of mercy, every piece of indisputable logic, every revealing parable only goes to anger them all the more. Their minds are now set against Him. Jesus does not snap, does not get unruly, does not turn away, His judgment is crisp and clear and evident and victorious to all honest observers. The faith of our Lord is not only in the past and the present, but, in the future; how pieces all come together as a whole. Words and deeds are one thing. The examples He lays out another. How they all play out in the end, that is the beautiful thing; the miraculous thing that can only be done by this God's servant and the spirit place upon Him.", "label": "clean"}

At every customer touch point it is essential that the service delivery matches the sales and marketing promise, regardless of the communication medium used.", "label": "clean"}

Some research indicated beta carotene may actually cause cancer, but this has not proven that eating carrots, unless in very large quantities – 2 to 3 kilos a day, can cause cancer. In fact, a substance called falcarinol that is found in carrots has been found to reduce the risk of cancer, according to researchers at Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences (DIAS). Kirsten Brandt, head of the research department, explained that isolated cancer cells grow more slowly when exposed to falcarinol. This substance is a polyacethylen, however, so it is important not to cook the carrots.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "One can even set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the following device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of the hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts.It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation.

(McGillivray expected and received a personal bribe of $1,200 a year to offset the bribe the Spanish were already paying him not to negotiate with the Americans.) Washington and the chiefs locked arms in Indian style and invoked the Great Spirit, and then the chiefs made their marks on the Treaty of New York, redrawing the borders for a sovereign Creek Nation. Washington reinforced the terms of the treaty by issuing the Proclamation of 1790, an Executive Order forbidding private or state encroachments on all Indian lands guaranteed by treaty with the United States.", "label": "clean"}

The campground is set in a woodsy area and many sites are secluded. The forest loop has Electricity and Water hookups but no sewer. Most of the other campsites outside the forest loop do not have hookups of any kind. All campsites have firepits and firewood is available at the local gas station for an unusually fair price or at the campground for not such a fair price.. This campground is a nice destination for a weeks stay. Lots of trails to walk and the weather seems to be a tad better then the surrounding areas. The only minus about this campground is the noise from the airplanes at the nearby military base. But they are fun to watch and normally stop flying by 9PM. We camped here in a camper.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "My wife had a Case of MRSA a few years ago. real disaster, near malpractice IMHO. anyway...she spent a week out in the woods, drove 10 hours home. Her knee started bothering her. took her to the ER. They diagnosed it as a knee trauma of some kind and referred her to an ortho guy. he drained fluid (but didn't analyze it) did xray, ultra-sound, MRI, cat-scan, never could find a problem. The knee swelled up the size of a volley ball. admitted her. The Hospital Bug guy (they all have bug killers) took one look, ran labs and put her on 3 sets of antibiotics. they ended up doing othroscopic surgery, flushing her knee with gallons of fluid, and putting her on a 3 week mult-drug intravenous antibiotic regime (at home). She lost most all the cartilage in her knee. having said that, my local (DC) TV did a story on MRSA last night, it was awful, the clown didnt have a clue. one of his best lines was:\"there are two strains of MRSA, one found in hospitals is serious, the one found in schools isn't, it responds well to antibiotics\" duh. the second kind is your average normal staf. if it responds to well antibiotics, it isn't MRSA you idiot", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "MR. CARDARELLI: Well, I think what they're doing right now is to ease monetary policy aggressively, and they're easing it aggressively especially in the economies where mortgage rate is higher where the mortgage market is more developed in the sense that it's easier for households to access mortgages, to use homes as collateral, to extract equity out of homes. And that's actually a very important conclusion of the chapter. What Simon said it's true, so we're recommending a more symmetric approach within this risk management monetary policy approach, but this is especially true, I would stress, in economies where mortgage markets are more developed; in economies where mortgage markets are less developed, there is sort of a less urgency in a way, to adopt this kind of behavior. And it's sort of something that you see going on right now so, for example, the Fed has been easing more aggressively than the ECB. There are structural differences in mortgage markets between the U.S. and Europe. Europe, according to our indexes, is—most of the countries in Europe have less developed mortgage markets than the U.S. This is consistent with what we're saying in our model, in our research saying in these kinds of economies when mortgage markets are less developed serve there's less volatility coming out of development in the housing sector. So, there is less of a need for monetary policy to respond strongly to house prices. For economies like the U.S. with a very developed mortgage market, there's more of a point in responding to house prices when things start changing as rapidly as they are now.", "label": "clean"}

That is a very different—very different statement, and we try to make that clear in the chapter.

The need for an external splint was suggested when the bone graft exceeds 5 cm (two-disc heights) to prevent graft-related complications [2,31]. However, the use of autologous bone is not without problems. Though we didn't encounter many problems due harvesting to autologous graft but haematomas, wound infections, neuropraxia, and pain are known complications when harvesting autologous bone .

The Department of Justice is not obligated to tell someone whether he or she is a target, so it can be good PR to say one is not officially a \"target of the investigation\" despite appearances otherwise. In answering questions posed by a reporter for KTUU in Anchorage, Alaska, Senator Stevens stumbled over whether he is a target of this investigation while noting that he has been involved in other investigations before (video here and transcript here). He said, \"I'm not sure I'm a target yet. I've not been told I'm a target. But as a practical matter, the situation -- I shouldn't have answered that question either . . .

Yet, it is generally agreed that the foundations for understanding criminal behavior, even the justification for the existence of the discipline of criminology, is rooted in psychobiological perspectives (Brown, 2006; Garland, 1997; Glicksohn, 2002; Jones, 2008). Many of those considered to be the founders of criminology collaborated with psychiatrists focusing on the rehabilitation and medical or psychological treatment of criminal deviance, viewing such behavior as a disease of the mind or intellect rather than holding to the more primitive explanations that attributed crime to manifestations of evil spirits or sinfulness (Hervé, 2007; Jones, 2008; Rafter, 2004).", "label": "clean"}

To investigate the changes in community responsiveness during the pre-community-outbreak phase of the H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong, a pooled sample of 999 adults was interviewed in three surveys (S1, S2, S3) from 7 May to 6 June 2009. Over time, fewer people felt confident in staying free from H1N1 infection in the following year (S1, 63·3%; S3, 46%; P<0·001). The level of distress due to H1N1 remained modest throughout the study period. People's confidence in the government's ability to control a large-scale H1N1 outbreak declined slightly at the third survey (S1, 80·5%; S3, 73·8%; P=0·025). Across the three surveys, respondents remained vigilant with frequent adoption of preventive measures (e.g. wearing face masks in public areas when suffering from influenza-like symptoms and frequent hand-washing). The public was generally supportive of the Hong Kong government although misconceptions regarding the disease were common. Provision of evidence-based public-health education is still warranted as the disease outbreak unfolds.", "label": "clean"}

These persons however are being moved and events are being shaped in each and every case by the Spirit. It is like reading a book trying to watch the author, but if the story is good enough you loose sight of the author. This author however was very much involved in the story, the very reason the characters were able to do the things that they did. In a sense the Acts of the Holy Spirit were brought forth physically through the Acts of the Apostles. I will have to re-read the book and try better to keep the focus!", "label": "clean"}

As a rear they are great for traction, even wet roots or moondust on hardpack but the tradeoff is super-soft rubber. And they don't just wear down the knobs kinda start tearing at the base right away, not just from breaking because they tear in all directions.

{"text": "Imaging mRNA with single-molecule sensitivity in live cells has become an indispensable tool for quantitatively studying RNA biology. The MS2 system has been extensively used due to its unique simplicity and sensitivity. However, the levels of the coat protein needed for consistent labeling of mRNAs limits the sensitivity and quantitation of this technology. Here, we applied fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy to quantitatively characterize and enhance the MS2 system. Surprisingly, we found that a high fluorescence background resulted from inefficient dimerization of fluorescent protein (FP)-labeled MS2 coat protein (MCP). To mitigate this problem, we used a single-chain tandem dimer of MCP (tdMCP) that significantly increased the uniformity and sensitivity of mRNA labeling. Furthermore, we characterized the PP7 coat protein and the binding to its respective RNA stem loop. We conclude that the PP7 system performs better for RNA labeling. Finally, we used these improvements to study endogenous β-actin mRNA, which has 24xMS2 binding sites inserted into the 3′ untranslated region. The tdMCP-FP allowed uniform RNA labeling and provided quantitative measurements of endogenous mRNA concentration and diffusion. This work provides a foundation for quantitative spectroscopy and imaging of single mRNAs directly in live cells.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "With the two main characters established, the story suddenly takes a major turn: it ignores them for hundreds of pages. There's something bigger afoot than the rivalry between two men: Gifu Prefecture is plagued with flooding, and the Tokugawa Shogunate assigns Satsuma the arduous task of taming the river, building a series of dikes and levies so that the peasants will never again have to fear floods. This outrageous request—to work as laborers in a foreign province—almost causes a rebellion, but eventually the Satsuma samurai swallow their pride and travel to Gifu Prefecture, where they work themselves to the bone, despite the shame it causes. \"True honor lies at the bottom of our heart. It is invisible to others, and it can never be violated!\" But is the whole dam-building scheme just an elaborate plot by the Tokugawa to drain the wealth and manpower of Satsuma? And are there limits to what a samurai will do…to how much humiliation a samurai will take??", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "I celebrate the days that I don’t have a list of committed reading titles. I’ve had committed reading lists quite often in the past six years… Or more. Chairing a statewide reading program that selects books for children grades 3-12 certainly lends me to knowing about terrific titles and anxiety over having the time to read them all. Also, having favorite authors, series, blogs, and ARCs, advanced reading copies, to read also loads it on. The other day I took a picture of part of my TBR, to be read, book pile for an online book group called The Nerdy Book Club. I stepped back and reflected on this weighty pile of treasures and asked myself, “what do I want to read but have put off out of guilt of keeping up with the ‘newly released’ books?” A few titles came to mind: Forge by Laurie Halse Anderson and Reckless by Cornelia Funke. Those two books are now my first priority. I’ve put off reading them for over a year… Or two. Clearing out the guilt and enjoying treasures, that’s my goal. Rescuing those treasures that have languished on my bookshelves for long enough is my new focus with reading. It helps to be “between” book clubs presently.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Though the origin of the word Halloween is Christian, the holiday is commonly thought to have pagan roots. Historian Nicholas Rogers, exploring the origins of Halloween, notes that while \"some folklorists have detected its origins in the Roman feast of Pomona, the goddess of fruits and seeds, or in the festival of the dead called Parentalia, it is more typically linked to the Celtic festival of Samhain\", which comes from the Old Irish for \"summer's end\". Samhain (pronounced SAH-win or SOW-in) was the first and most important of the four quarter days in the medieval Gaelic (Irish, Scottish and Manx) calendar. It was held on or about October 31 – November 1 and kindred festivals were held at the same time of year in other Celtic lands; for example the Brythonic Calan Gaeaf (in Wales), Kalan Gwav (in Cornwall) and Kalan Goañv (in Brittany). Samhain is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and many important events in Irish mythology happen or begin on Samhain. It marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the 'darker half' of the year. This was a time for stock-taking and preparing for the cold winter ahead; cattle were brought back down from the summer pastures and livestock were slaughtered. In much of the Gaelic world, bonfires were lit and there were rituals involving them. Some of these rituals hint that they may once have involved human sacrifice. Divination games or rituals were also done at Samhain.", "label": "clean"}

Arthur has come a long way from his first adventure, and he's learning to shoulder his new responsibilities, as much as he wishes he didn't have to. I enjoyed revisiting some of the characters from the previous book, as well as meeting some new ones and learning a little more about the mysterious Architect, who built the House and the secondary realms (of which the Earth is but one), and who left it all in the hands of such underhanded trustees as Mister Monday, Grim Tuesday, and the other morrow days. I'm very interested to see where Arthur's adventures take him in the subsequent book, Drowned Wednesday, in this very original fantasy series.", "label": "clean"}

By studying data from 2 newsgroups, alt.feminism and soc.feminism, she demonstrates that discrimination and exclusion/hostility can continue to occur, even in a supposedly inclusive and politically feminist context. She concentrates on the ethos of the newsgroups as the basis for constructing either a welcoming or distancing communication arena. My interest in this article stems from this notion of ethos because I think that it a highly influencing factor which combines with inherent linguistic features of women's speech to produce a speech community. I believe that any future discussions of the social structure of online communication must address ethos as well as linguistic differences in order to prevent factionalization or balkanization of men and women online, much as one might approach a dialog about multiculturalism and the internet.", "label": "clean"}

It’s a magical feeling that drives this CD, and will feel so great to people who loved CDs like Heir Apparent’s ‘One small voice’ and Lethal’s ‘Programmed’. The guitarists, Kevin Grose and J.L. Prater, bring the sharp metal edge to the music, delivering tight palm muted riffs through the verses and choruses, with precise rhythm, and offering up great leads and solos. “Ravn”, the bassist, who brings some European metal credibility from Norway to the U.S., lays down the pulsing, driving flow of the rhythm for the CD. Wade Helm on drums does a great job not just providing a solid, roaring, metal back-beat, but incorporates fantastic rhythms within the overall tempo that gives the drums a quasi-melody, a powerful voice that is more than just speed.

Indeed it can, as can linalool, the other major constituent of lavender oil (Sköld et al 2004). However, these are theoretical risks, not actual risks, and lavender oil oxidation is a process that takes many months, even years. What this research suggests is that products containing lavender oil should be protected from oxidation by the addition of antioxidants, and that very old products should be discarded. The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) does not have a regulation for lavender oil, but it does for linalool. Referring to linalool-rich essential oils, the IFRA guideline recommends the addition of an antioxidant: “The addition of 0.1% BHT or a-tocopherol has shown great efficiency” (IFRA 2009).", "label": "clean"}

In one of the biggest freefalls in Nielsen ratings history, Laverne & Shirley went from the number one-watched show in the country (for the second year running) for the 1978-1979 season, to the bottom of the barrel when ABC inexplicably swapped the timeslots of two of their most successful shows: Laverne & Shirley out of its established Tuesday 8:30pm slot, with what the network thought was their next big smash, the much-hyped Angie, starring Saturday Night Fever's Donna Pescow and Airplane's Robert Hayes at its Thursday 8:30pm time slot (Angie had garnered a rather astounding 5th most-watched show of the previous season with just a mid-season start in February). Wrong on both counts. The move decimated both show's ratings, with once-promising Angie cancelled by the spring of 1980, and Laverne & Shirley first quickly hustled to Monday nights at 8:00pm (where it got creamed by Little House on the Prairie), and then back to its Tuesday 8:30pm slot in February. Ratings ticked up, but not even close enough for Laverne & Shirley to crack the Nielsen Top Thirty―a humiliating, completely unnecessary showing for a series that wasn't \"broke\" in the first place. Laverne & Shirley's sixth season would see the ratings rise higher again...but nowhere near its previous glory.", "label": "clean"}

The peace is soon shattered when a sudden upsurge of bugs in the Yggdrasil system that sustains the goddesses heralds a catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions. Left with tragedy on their hands and the imminent destruction of Heaven and Earth, the sisters do the only thing they can to save everything: execute a system restore point for Yggdrasil, resetting everything to a time back shortly before Keiichi first met Belldandy. Although the effort seems to be successful, only the trio of goddesses retain their memory of the original timeline, and gradually differences start to crop up between the new timeline and the old one. The goddesses strive to prevent the circumstances leading up to the previous calamity from happening, even as the universe seems intent on correcting itself and even if that means Belldandy must, this time, maintain some distance from Keiichi.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Before moving on to the Urrutia debate, it should be remarked that there were also some very positive signs coming out of the Haarlem tournament, and these plusses should not be altogether overlooked by Team Cuba boosters. Key to victory in China will be the ability of Cuba’s talented but untested pitching staff to hold in check the professional bats displayed by the USA, Japanese and Canadian lineups (all of which will boast top minor leaguers or all-star Japanese League talents). Cuban hitters can not be expected to carry the load if the veteran starting corps of Vera, Palma, Maya, Jonder Martínez and Yulieski González and the bullpen contingent of Norberto González, Yadir Pedroso, Odelín and Lazo fails to keep the club in games into late innings, when most Cuban squads tend to work their magic. Going into Haarlem my own biggest fear concerning this edition of Team Cuba was precisely the pitching—Lazo is not the same closer he was five years ago, Yulieski González has been consistently brilliant at home but not always effective in international outings, Odelín has not been the same pitcher of late he was in Sydney in 2000 or in San Juan during the WBC miracle. Yet the pitching was indeed solid enough in Haarlem, with Cuba’s sub-2.00 team ERA topped only by the stellar American staff. Vera, Maya and Jonder Martínez were all especially sharp, and Lazo at times looked like the true Lazo of old, especially in the closing innings of the clutch semifinal win over surprising Japan. Only two decidedly disastrous outings by Yulieski González (versus the opportunistic Americans and Japanese) fell squarely on the negative side of the ledger. And the hitting, if consistently sub par, was nonetheless of the clutch variety in all games but two. Bell’s crucial blast in the semifinals sealed a vital victory needed to reach the finals; Despaigne’s pinch-hit double in the seventh rescued the opener with the Dutch Antilles; Cuba had its chances to pull out the first match with the Americans (runners on second and third in the ninth, with only one out and Meriño and Urgelles coming to the plate); and if Despaigne had not been badly jammed on a wicked slider from MLB-prospect Kyle Gibson with the bases loaded and one out in the home eighth of the finale, perhaps no one would today be talking of slumps or of failures during the Haarlem Honkbal Week. More times than not baseball is still truly a game of mere inches.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "A speech in which Clinton for all intents and purposes defined himself and his party for the last two years of his tenure in the White House was all of 10 minutes long. Actually to say what he said didn’t require more than ten minutes. The most quoted line from that speech was: “My rule for the next two years will be country first, and politics as usual dead last.” However, in the rest of the speech he announced that he would be doing precisely the opposite of that. For, following the line of the DLC, he said essentially that he would be playing the tax-cut, cut welfare, “get tough on crime” game along with the Republicans. As pointed out earlier, none of these proposals addressed the real problems the country faced. In a contemporary article in the Long Island (NY) newspaper Newsday (Dec. 18, 1994) entitled “Middle Class Angst,” the problems of that large group, presented numerous times previously in this book were summarized: falling family incomes, job insecurity, declining hope for the future, declining number of high-paying jobs, declining number of permanent jobs related to manufacturing. The relevance of the DLC/Republican program to these problems? Zero.", "label": "clean"}

Likewise, Duncan has promised to subsidize states to develop data systems for the evaluation of teachers by the gains their students make on standardized tests. Yet because the only standardized tests that can be used for this purpose are in math and reading, teachers being evaluated in this way will have even more incentives to stress only basic skills, and downplay other aspects of a well-rounded curriculum. (That the statistical technology does not exist to accurately link a teacher’s quality to her students’ test scores is yet another problem.)", "label": "clean"}

International organizations including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have demonstrated much more interest in the energy sector than in mining, and are active in promoting markets for energy generation and transfer. Energy-hungry neighbours, China, Pakistan, India and Afghanistan, are also interested in the prospect of benefiting from the development of Central Asia hydropower through the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Trade and Transmission (CASA-1000) or other projects. Currently, Tajikistan has about 5 000 MW of installed hydropower capacity and Kyrgyzstan has 2 700 MW, less than 10 per cent of their technically feasible hydropower potential. Russia, China and Iran are interested in investments in the hydropower sector. Planned and ongoing projects aim to further expand hydropower capacity on the rivers with existing power cascades, chiefly on the Vakhsh in Tajikistan and on the Naryn in Kyrgyzstan.

Nobody wants to be a victim. The police are trying to help but it is an extremely rare cybercrime case in which a victim actually recovers their lost money . Time dealing with cybercrime is also lost forever.

Se conocía como México al Imperio Azteca y toda el área donde se hablaba náhuatl —actualmente la región circundante a la ciudad de México. Durante 300 años los colonizadores españoles se refirieron a ella como Nueva España. Cuando en 1821 México resurgió como una nación soberana, sus fronteras se extendían desde California a Guatemala. En ese entonces era un antiguo e inmenso territorio conformado por regiones étnica, lingüística y económicamente diversas que luchaban por adquirir unidad nacional. Texas (en ese entonces parte de los estados mexicanos de Coahuila y Tejas) era una región fronteriza lejos de las densas urbes y de los fértiles valles de México central, donde se reclutaban inmigrantes de los Estados Unidos. En el año 1836 este territorio mexicano se declaró como república independiente (y más tarde, estado de EE.UU.), convirtiéndose en el primer calderón de la cultura mexicoamericana. Hacia 1853, el gobierno de México, el vecino débil de un Estados Unidos en expansión, había perdido el territorio de los actuales estados de California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Nuevo México, Texas y partes de Colorado y Wyoming. A pesar de la imposición de un nuevo límite fronterizo, la presencia histórica y ocupacional de los españoles, mexicanos y pueblos indígenas, junto a sus descendientes mestizos, constituiría a lo largo del tiempo una influencia determinante para el desarrollo del Oeste Americano.", "label": "non-english"}

(After looking at a few years of predictable data, most companies have dropped most such requirements.) Usually it's a no-brainer: you can see the hernia as the pants are coming down. But I've had a couple of people in whom, for the life of me, I couldn't confirm the hernia for which they were scheduled to be operated. It's uncomfortable. Often, because the mandated need for a second opinion was realized at the last minute, I'd be seeing the person within a day or so of the operation. In part, it (the non-finding) happens because you can't always feel a hernia, even when it's there. They don't always pop out on command, with office maneuvers. I'd explain that to the patient, and tell them the fact that I can't feel it doesn't mean it's not there.... Unpleasant, mutually. When the patient had symptoms, and described what surely must have been a hernia, I always explained that it was a probably a safe assumption. But sometimes it was a person in whom the \"hernia\" had been found on a physical exam, and there'd been no signs or symptoms at all. When such a person was sent to me directly from the primary doc, I'd generally recommend against surgery until things were more clear, trying also to avoid any implication that their doc was wrong. But what to do when it's a second opinion referral from a surgeon who had them on the dotted line?", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "It's the 200th birthday of Romantic composer and piano virtuoso Franz Liszt (1811). He was born in Raiding, Hungary, and was composing by the age of eight. By the time he was 16, he was exhausted from studying and touring all over Europe, and he expressed a desire to become a priest. He earned his living as a piano teacher after his father died, and when he was 17, he fell in love with one of his pupils. Her father insisted she end the romance, at which point Liszt became so ill that his obituary appeared in a Paris newspaper. He gave up on the idea of the priesthood, but later in life spent many years composing religious music inspired by his interest in Gregorian plainsong; the religious establishment didn't approve of it, and so it wasn't published until many years after his death. In the 1860s, following the death of two of his children, he eventually joined a monastery outside Rome. Though he received the four minor orders of porter, acolyte, exorcist, and lector, he never became a priest.", "label": "clean"}

Even if we did not find that it was too late for appellants to argue that section 8(f) prohibits timber harvesting in the Duck Creek area, they would not prevail on this issue. Section 8 is entitled \"Management plan for recreation areas.\" 16 U.S.C. Sec. 460gg-5. Section 8(f)9 must thus be interpreted as part of a Congressional effort to describe the process by which the CMP is to be developed, the issues it must consider, and what may occur in the HCNRA while the CMP is under preparation. If section 8(f) is read in the context of section 8 as a whole, it becomes evident that section 8(f) addresses only that period of time between passage of the Act and development of the CMP and is not relevant to the Duck Creek timber sale. Appellants argue that the legislative history of the Act supports their interpretation of section 8(f). Their arguments appear to have little force. Because the statute is clear on it face, however, we need not be concerned with legislative history in interpreting its scope. See Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 184 n. 29, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2296 n. 29, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978).", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Legislation raises awkward issues. Although forced marriage itself is not a British criminal offence, the violent actions that often ensue are criminal offences, and any non-consensual sex is of course rape. Many victims have pointed out that they would not have been forced into marriage by their parents had forcible marriage been made a criminal offence. Yet there is the concern that if the practice is made a criminal offence, it would not be eliminated but only go underground, preventing legal action against this abhorrent trend. Hence the British government has proceeded cautiously in this regard. The English Forced Marriages (Civil Protection) Act 2007 is only a civil measure. But the pressure to take firm action is building. Visa regulations for young married people from abroad joining British spouses have been tightened. The British Parliament’s Home Affairs Select Committee has suggested that the subjects of forced marriages and honour killings be made a compulsory part of the sex and relationships curriculum in schools. Other agencies in the U.K. are now becoming aware of this problem. But this awareness must translate into concerted efforts to stop forced marriages, which are nothing but the criminal abuse of hapless women.", "label": "clean"}

Then, the entire aromatic mess is blitzed with an immersion blender until pureed, but still chunky. With a wooden spoon, I whipped in a few cups of grated Parmesan and half a cup of good Italian olive oil. What appeared next was one of the most voluminous, gorgeous sauces I’ve ever made. It’s rustic and pasty — who likes that wan, pale shade of beige, anyway? — but the taste is totally remarkable. There’s that faintest shade of garlic, the salty punch of cheese, those sweet, earthy walnuts, and the tang and heft of the milk-soaked bread. I used Rachel’s recipe as a guideline and inspiration more than anything else, but if you’d like to follow it exactly, you can find it here.

But Brown's Gas has at least 66,000 BTUs per pound, and the inventor found a way of getting it up to 210,000 BTUs, which is almost at a nuclear level. If just 80% of this energy can be recaptured, it will be a significant improvement over the main problem with all variable-power input systems: energy storage -- solar, wind, tidal etc; of course, tidal is not important to Ontario. The gas storage development is of a very high priority for future developmental work in this area, yet experience suggests that the off-the-shelf liquid petroleum gas technology storage system is adaptable to Brown's Gas.

{"text": "The work of religious education in California is confined almost exclusively to institutions under Catholic auspices. In California the Catholic Church, notwithstanding that she receives no financial aid from the State, and that the support of her schools and colleges must be derived entirely from contributions of the faithful, has done great things in the cause of Christian education. The great pioneers of Catholic education in California were the Jesuits. In 1851 Santa Clara College was founded by the venerable Father John Nobili, S.J. This was followed, four years later, by the establishment of St. Ignatius College in San Francisco under the leadership of the Rev. Anthony Maraschi, S.J. From the days of these small beginnings the zeal of those charged with the education of Catholic youth has been untiring, progress has been steady, and the results already achieved have more than compensated for the sacrifices and expenditures which the work entailed. The following figures for the year 1907 will give some idea of the importance of Catholic education in California: 1 archdiocesan seminary, 5 seminaries of religious orders, 1 normal school, 11 colleges, academies and high schools for boys, 47 academies for girls, 73 parochial schools, 31,814 young people under Catholic care . Besides the institutions just mentioned there are numerous orphan asylums, industrial school, infant asylums, day homes and a protectory for boys to which is attached a boys' industrial farm at Rutherford. In addition to the colleges in charge of the Jesuits already mentioned, the Christian Brothers conduct Sacred Heart College in San Francisco, and St. Mary's College in Oakland. St. Vincent's College, in Los Angeles, is under the care of the Vincentian Fathers. There are several other universities and colleges, as well as numerous grammar, primary and secondary schools and kindergartens, under private management.", "label": "clean"}

Georges Duthen described the mood of the French players before their first Test in 1958: \"They were going into battle. A Battle for France. And they hadn't a hope...\" France exceeded expectations and drew 3–3 with after a drop goal to French scrum-half Pierre Danos and unconverted try to South Africa's Butch Lochner. The French then secured a Test series victory in South Africa with their 9–5 victory in front of 90,000 spectators in Johannesburg. The French feared the South African forwards, especially their scrum, and focused much of their training before the series on improving the \"South African\" style of their forwards. The decisive moment of the match was French forward Jean Barthe's tackle on Jan Prinsloo near the French try-line prevented a certain try. The momentum then swung to France who scored drop-goals—one each to Pierre Lacaze and Roger Martine—to secure the historic victory.", "label": "clean"}

Far be it from me to argue: Of the 17 titles I’ve managed to shoehorn into the 10 slots below (with an eye toward potential double and triple features), all but four are American or American co-productions. Even more notable than this surfeit may be the fact that some of the most venturesome work in this annus mirabilis for homegrown cinema came in movies produced and/or released by the major Hollywood studios or their subsidiary “specialty” divisions. Not that the news was always good: Two of those films, Zodiac and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, were expensive commercial failures, while the box-office fate of the riskiest venture of them all, Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood, remains to be seen.

Victoria catered dessert at the event Ted was attending, and to clear his conscience as well as spend time with her, Ted goes home with her to help clean up the kitchen. During their encounter, Ted discovers that Victoria is about to get engaged and also the real reason their relationship did not work out. Meanwhile Lily and Marshall, thinking Barney is drunk and off his game, make a bet with him; if Barney's hibachi chef skills match that of their chef, tricks included, he gets to touch Lily's pregnancy endowed chest, if he loses he has to wear Marshall's ducky tie for a year. Turns out Barney scammed Lily and Marshall, and has been training to be a hibachi chef for months. While Barney is performing his chef tricks, Lily distracts him by flashing her chest causing him to mess up, resulting in him losing the bet, and having to wear the ducky tie.", "label": "clean"}

Instead, he has been pushed into the defensive because he doesn't want to play the same multi-billion euro game when it comes to economic stimulus. ... That has made him angry -- and sometimes he explodes. Steinbrück is right to question the effects of (the British tax cuts). Nobody knows if such stimulus measures really work -- especially given that nobody knows yet how the crisis will develop further. Only one thing is sure: as opposed to the bank guarantees which will hopefully not have to be written off, economic stimulus money is gone. The expenses from today are the debts of tomorrow -- but thinking it terms of generations is unpopular these days. Steinbrück is on the right path, but he shouldn't scare off the partners that he needs. His mistake is not what he is doing, rather it is what he is saying.\"", "label": "clean"}

Meadows and tundra-like ecosystems are found on high mountain plateaus. Globally endangered species resident in the mountains include the snow leopard (with more than half of global population) and the Marco Polo sheep. The numbers of these species have declined, however, as a result of poaching, hunting and the depletion of the food base. The high biodiversity richness and endemism of flora and fauna of the mountains of Central Asia is exemplified by the fact that the number of vascular plant species found in the Pamir-Alai or the Tien Shan Mountains is four times higher than that of the nearby lowland Karakum Desert, which has twice the area.", "label": "clean"}

Here, Icon Group graphically reports, for each part of the financial statement, the larger gaps that the firm has vis-à-vis the leading competitors. A gap need not be a bad sign. Rather, it is simply a substantial difference that might merit further attention or signal a firms relative strength or weakness for the coming fiscal year.

{"text": "For young women, the culture that has been media produced is most often attributed to the extremely thin look that has been linked to awful disorders such as Bulimia and Anorexia. For young men, this culture has led to the notion that the ideal male image is extremely muscular - the more, the better. Combined with a drive for athletic excellence that has fueled young athletes to take whatever means necessary to \"gain the edge,\" has led to an explosion of use of performance enhancing drugs by young athletes. Recently, the news has been aflutter with stories of steroid use in baseball with \"greats\" such as Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi being implicated.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of risk loci for many complex disorders, including Crohn's disease. However, common disease-associated SNPs explain at most approximately 20% of the genetic variance for Crohn's disease. Several factors may account for this unexplained heritability, including rare risk variants not adequately tagged thus far in GWAS. That rare susceptibility variants indeed contribute to variation in multifactorial phenotypes has been demonstrated for colorectal cancer, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, blood pressure, type 1 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and, in the case of Crohn's disease, for NOD2 (refs. 14,15). Here we describe the use of high-throughput resequencing of DNA pools to search for rare coding variants influencing susceptibility to Crohn's disease in 63 GWAS-identified positional candidate genes. We identify low frequency coding variants conferring protection against inflammatory bowel disease in IL23R, but we conclude that rare coding variants in positional candidates do not make a large contribution to inherited predisposition to Crohn's disease.

However, my favorite mechanic, an excellent local Audi expert and racer and Audi loyalist to the bone, insists that the 2.7T engine is REALLY bad news. In fact, he's convinced that Audi should recall them for updates. According to him, it seems that Audi dropped the ball on the 4-valve v-block design causing seals to break down after 60K miles. He's already rebuilt 12 of these engines over the past year, all with <100K miles.", "label": "clean"}
