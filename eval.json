      "Adrian Peterson happy to trade carries for catches",
      "EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. \u2014 Adrian Peterson carried the Minnesota Vikings' offense the past four seasons and doesn't have a single playoff victory to show for it.",
      "So, the former MVP says he's on board with new coordinator Norv Turner's plan to change Peterson's role and the offense \u2014 if it means the Vikings are playing in January.",
      "\"My rushing yards might not be up to par, but it's not about that,\" Peterson said Thursday during the team's minicamp. \"It's all about winning. I'm trying to win a championship, so if that (means) taking less of a pounding and being more productive in the pass game, I'm all-in for it.\"",
      "The changes were obvious from the time players reported for the offseason program last month and began learning Turner's derivative of the precision Air Coryell offense, which Peterson compared to \"performing heart surgery without having the license to do so.\"",
      "For a team that hasn't ranked better than 23rd in passing since Brett Favre threw them within a field goal of the Super Bowl in the 2009 season, it's not just new terminology and a complex scheme, but a new mindset Turner is installing as well.",
      "\"His philosophy is we're going to pass the ball to open up the run game,\" receiver Greg Jennings told USA TODAY Sports. \"Don't get me wrong \u2013 we're still going to feature Adrian. But in Norv's offense, he's going to take a lot of that wear and tear off Adrian's body, I'll say that.\"",
      "Turner, 61, has the track record to sell his vision. He coordinated two Super Bowl champions with the Dallas Cowboys in the early 1990s and had the NFL's No. 1-ranked offense four years ago with Philip Rivers in San Diego.",
      "In Minnesota, Turner inherited a quarterback situation barely more settled than the mess he dealt with last year in Cleveland. But there is talent to work with at the skill positions, starting with Peterson, Jennings, dynamic weapon Cordarrelle Patterson and big tight end Kyle Rudolph.",
      "\"I keep trying to create more space so when (Peterson) breaks one from the line of scrimmage there aren't two guys waiting for him,\" Turner told USA TODAY Sports. \"And that's easier said than done, because to do that, we've got to get our wideouts involved. We've got to get the tight ends making plays where the linebackers are concerned about something more than just the run.\"",
      "That's been the problem in recent years for the Vikings, who have handed off to Peterson 1,118 times since 2010 and used six quarterbacks while going 24-39-1 with one wild-card playoff exit and two head coaching changes in that span.",
      "Peterson ran for 2,097 yards in his 2012 MVP season. But injuries limited him to 14 games in 2013, and he had an adductor repair and release in January \u2014 his third surgery in as many offseasons at age 29.",
      "From that perspective, lightening Peterson's workload seems like a no-brainer, though he said he's excited to be more involved in the passing game under Turner, whose offenses always have at least one running back around 50 catches. Peterson's career high is 43.",
      "\"He's going to catch passes,\" Turner said. \"You've got to try to utilize all the guys that can make plays, and I think you need to be able to run the ball in this league. But I think if all you do is run it, it gets real hard.\"",
      "Settling on a quarterback would help. Veteran Matt Cassel took the first-team reps during minicamp, with Christian Ponder behind him and a rookie likely to join after next week's draft.",
      "The Vikings figure to draft another running back, too, with backup Toby Gerhart departed to Jacksonville and no guaranteed money remaining on Peterson's contract, which is scheduled to pay him $12 million in salary and bonus money this year.",
      "\"If they do, I feel like they have a good reason to do it,\" Peterson said. \"It's always competition out there, and that's what I feed off of.\"",
      "Last season, the Browns led the NFL in pass attempts with a carousel of Brandon Weeden, Brian Hoyer and Jason Campbell under center. But they didn't have a player in the backfield like Peterson, who figures to get his touches one way or another.",
      "In 23 seasons as an NFL head coach or coordinator, nine of Turner's offenses have ranked in the top 10 in yards per rush attempt. More important, 16 of those teams ranked in the top half of the league in scoring.",
      "\"It depends on what Norv is looking at and how he's trying to attack the defense and who he's going to showcase,\" Jennings said. \"What Cordarrelle brings to the table is great. What Jerome Simpson brings to the table is great. What Kyle brings to the table.",
      "\"We have a ton of pieces, and I haven't even mentioned Adrian, who's been the main focal point of this franchise for years. I'm sure we'll still remain that way. But you're going to see a much more balanced attack.\""

      "WASHINGTON - The Obama administration has cleared the way for U.S. states to legalize Internet poker and certain other online betting in a switch that may help them reap billions in tax revenue and spur web-based gambling.",
      "A Justice Department opinion dated September and made public on Friday reversed decades of previous policy that included civil and criminal charges against operators of some of the most popular online poker sites.",
      "Until now, the department held that online gambling in all forms was illegal under the Wire Act of 1961, which bars wagers via telecommunications that cross state lines or international borders.",
      "The new interpretation, by the department's Office of Legal Counsel, said the Wire Act applies only to bets on a \"sporting event or contest,\" not to a state's use of the Internet to sell lottery tickets to adults within its borders or abroad.",
      "\"The United States Department of Justice has given the online gaming community a big, big present,\" said I. Nelson Rose, a gaming law expert at Whittier Law School who consults for governments and the industry.",
      "The question at issue was whether proposals by Illinois and New York to use the Internet and out-of-state transaction processors to sell lottery tickets to in-state adults violated the Wire Act.",
      "But the department's conclusion would eliminate \"almost every federal anti-gambling law that could apply to gaming that is legal under state laws,\" Rose wrote on his blog at www.gamblingandthelaw.com.",
      "If a state legalized intra-state games such as poker, as Nevada and the District of Columbia have done, \"there is simply no federal law that could apply\" against their operators, he said.",
      "The department's opinion, written by Assistant Attorney General Virginia Seitz, said the law's legislative history showed that Congress's overriding goal had been to halt wire communications for sports gambling, notably off-track betting on horse races.",
      "Congress also had been concerned about rapid transmission of betting information on baseball, basketball, football and boxing among other sports-related events or contests, she summarized the legislative history as showing.",
      "\"The ordinary meaning of the phrase 'sporting event or contest' does not encompass lotteries,\" Seitz wrote. \"Accordingly, we conclude that the proposed lotteries are not within the prohibitions of the Wire Act.\"",
      "The department expressed no opinion about a provision in the law that lets prosecutors shut down phone lines where interstate or foreign gambling is taking place.",
      "Many of the 50 U.S. states may be interested in creating online lotteries to boost tax revenues and help offset the ripple effect of a federal deficit-reduction push.",
      "The global online gambling industry grew 12 percent last year to as much as $30 billion, according to a survey in March by Global Betting and Gaming Consultancy, based on the Isle of Man, where online gambling is legal.",
      "Federal prosecutors in April charged three of the biggest Internet poker companies with fraud and money-laundering along with violations of another federal law, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Act of 2006.",
      "The government outlined an alleged scheme by owners of the three largest online poker companies - Full Tilt Poker, Absolute Poker and PokerStars - to funnel gambling profits to online shell companies that would appear legitimate to banks processing payments. (Editing by Derek Caney)",

      "Is Ohio the Real Garden of Eden?",
      "Ohio is a pretty nice place, sure, but could it have been the Garden of Eden? Not a metaphoric Garden of Eden, mind you, but the real, true thing? The notion would seem to strike many people as absurd, not the least reason being that it\u2019s a stretch to believe the Bible\u2019s take on Creation is the literal truth.",
      "Ohio is a pretty nice place, sure, but could it have been the Garden of Eden?",
      "Not a metaphoric Garden of Eden, mind you, but the real, true thing?",
      "The notion would seem to strike many people as absurd, not the least reason being that it\u2019s a stretch to believe the Bible\u2019s take on Creation is the literal truth.",
      "Another reason is that it positions the Garden as the spot where four rivers \u2014 Pishon, Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates \u2014 branch out. The first two are mysteries but the last two are actually in the Middle East.",
      "But at one time a case was made that Serpent Mound in Adams County \u2014 southwest Ohio\u2019s greatest example of land art and one of the nation\u2019 best known earthworks \u2014 was indeed the actual Garden of Eden. And the story of that theory, as well as a lot of others about the Garden\u2019s actual location, are discussed in a delightfully provocative and well-researched recent book, Brook Wilensky-Lanford\u2019s Paradise Lust: Searching for the Garden of Eden. Some of those theories are flawed but thoughtful and even scholarly; others are breathtakingly half-baked.",
      "It\u2019s been established that Ohio\u2019s famous 1,348-foot-long raised effigy of a serpent was constructed by ancient American Indian cultures. Why has yet to be firmly decided. It might have been used as a calendar; the fact that the coiled serpent\u2019s open mouth points toward an oval shape has been taken as a symbol of fertility, or as a sanctuary where people could gather during solar eclipses.",
      "As Wilensky-Lanford recounts, however, an Adams County native, Reverend Edmund Landon West, first claimed in 1901 that it was actually the true, God-created Garden of Eden. After all, the serpent was the one that gave Eve the forbidden fruit with disastrous results. And here was that serpent! Not only that, but three branches of Brush Creek flow nearby.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that Serpent Mound had already been well-studied by 1901, and neither Ohio nor America was a superstitious place. Harvard University\u2019s Peabody Museum had undertaken a restoration of the mound and then given it to the Ohio Historical Society a year before West\u2019s theory was voiced. So he was seen as an oddity at the time.",
      "Wilensky-Lanford, who has read West\u2019s 18-page pamphlet Eden\u2019s Land and Garden With Their Marks Yet to Be Seen (I have not) says his theory turns on a couple key points: He didn\u2019t believe the mound\u2019s builders could have been Indians. \u201cHe believed the Mound Builders were America\u2019s first people: Christian people who \u2018most assuredly\u2019 knew something of the Bible events recorded in Serpent Mound,\u201d she writes. In fact, she says of West\u2019s theory, humans from Adam through Noah lived in Ohio until the Great Flood, when he built his Ark on the Mississippi River and then traveled 48 miles a day (or 7,500 miles in five months) from the Gulf of Mexico to Mount Ararat in Armenia.",
      "This theory is enjoyable yet silly. But it sounds downright scientific compared to another theory that Wilensky-Lanford mentions, Dr. George C. Allen\u2019s 19th Century belief that the Garden of Eden started off at the North Pole but rotated around the world every 25,000 years until coming to rest \u2014 at that time \u2014 under Cincinnati. So start digging.",
      "If only another Cincinnati-area connection \u2014 a museum \u2014 to the Garden of Eden that Wilensky-Lanford mentions were so amusing. But her extensive consideration of the anti-evolution, science-denying Fundamentalism manifested at Northern Kentucky\u2019s Creation Museum actually is quite sobering and troubling. While many people view the place as kitsch, she doesn\u2019t. That museum is based on a literal reading of the Bible and its Book of Genesis.",
      "Visiting the museum in 2008, Wilensky-Lanford walks through its Garden of Eden exhibit. \u201cEach new scene came with a placard matter-of-factly stating biblical interpretation as if it were an explanatory caption,\u201d she writes. Yet, amid all the literalism, she notes the exhibit never states exactly where the actual Garden might have been.",
      "Then it hits her \u2014 admitting that a Garden of Eden ever could have existed on earth would defeat the point of the evangelism: to prepare Fundamentalist Christians for perfection in heaven \u2014 a new Garden \u2014 after the rapture.",
      "\u201cAs ideas about the Garden go, I found this empty, invisible Eden disappointing,\u201d she writes of the exhibit. \u201c(Other proposed locations), however far-fetched, were human. \u2026The Creation Museum\u2019s empty Eden brought to my mind \u2026 coldness.\u201d \u201cAs ideas about the Garden go, I found this empty, invisible Eden disappointing,\u201d she writes of the exhibit. \u201c(Other proposed locations), however far-fetched, were human. \u2026The Creation Museum\u2019s empty Eden brought to my mind \u2026 coldness.\u201d",
      "Adam and Eve would probably prefer Serpent Mound to the Creation Museum, based on Wilensky-Lanford\u2019s description.",

Stories here and here. A copy of the complaint is here. The suit is brought as a class action onbehalf of all purchasers of the book and seeks damages. The complaint recites a long litany of alleged factual inaccuracies.",
      "This is not a situation like A Million Little Pieces, in which a book represented to be a memoir turned out to contain substantial portions that were fiction. I am no expert on New York's consumer deception law, but even if the suit states a claim that can be proven under that law or the other common law theories invoked in the complaint, I think the free speech guarantee precludes any liability. The closest analog is the constitutional law of defamation. Absent actual knowledge of the false statement of fact made about a public figure, or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the statement, the First Amendment protects such falsity. Here, the statements made to promote the book are of public concern and, at the very least, the plaintiffs should have to prove that they were deliberately false or made with reckless disregard. Indeed, I think that the burden on the plaintiffs should be even higher, as it seems to me that this suit is all about chilling speech. Promotion of a book on a topic of high public interest by a key public figure should be insulated from attack unless there is proof that the statements were made with knowledge of their falsity.",

      "We'll still call Australia home, says Murdoch as News flies off",
      "News Corp, Australia's largest newspaper company, technically left the country for good yesterday. But its 73-year-old chairman wants Australians to know he has not abandoned them.",
      "\"It is not just that we call ourselves an Australian company; the better indicator is that is how others see us,\" Rupert Murdoch told shareholders at News's AGM in Adelaide, where it all began.",
      "But as he spoke there was a sense of history not lost on those closest to him, among them his daughter, Prudence MacLeod, who made a rare appearance at the meeting.",
      "She is the only child from his marriage to the late Patricia Booker and the first of his six children.",
      "\"It's sad but exciting, and it's historic,\" Ms MacLeod said. \"But there will be a meeting every year so that's nice.\"",
      "Ms MacLeod, who sat in the front row next to Mr Murdoch's sister, Janet Calvert-Jones, said the connection with Adelaide would be maintained. \"I mean it's an Australian company, at least in everyone's head,\" she said.",
      "Despite some complaints about News's low dividend and disappointment that Australian investors would lose some tax advantages, shareholders overwhelmingly approved a resolution to reincorporate in Delaware.",
      "The $65 billion company long ago outgrew its Australian base and says it hopes its move to the US, where it already earns the bulk of its profits, will attract big US fund managers.",
      "Its decision to incorporate in Delaware, a state with some of the weakest protection for small shareholders in the US, also solidifies the Murdoch family's 30 per cent control.",
      "But yesterday, Mr Murdoch - who received the keys to the city of Adelaide on Monday - was more interested in talking about matters of the heart.",
      "\"Let me state for the record, our Australian businesses will continue to be an integral part of the larger News Corporation,\" the chairman said.",
      "\"We have been in the Australian newspaper business a long time. The reincorporation in no way marks a retreat from the Australian market. For as long as my family is a major shareholder in this company - and let me assure you that will be a very, very long time, as far as we are concerned - News Corporation will always be defined by an Australian spirit.",
      "\"It is from Australia that this company derives its entrepreneurial energy, brashness, and as you walk through our New York corridors, often our accents.\"",
      "From his first day as a publisher in Adelaide back in 1954, to his push into the UK newspaper markets in the 1970s and '80s and finally his decision to take on rival media players in US publishing, free-to-air and pay television, Mr Murdoch has been a force to be reckoned with.",
      "Building on his father Keith's more modest media empire, Rupert went on to become one of the most politically influential media barons.",
      "Now his sons Lachlan and James are involved in the business. But it's unclear if investors will feel so warmly about the company when Rupert is not in charge.",
      "Before heading out of the meeting for tea and biscuits yesterday, some shareholders wondered aloud whether News's decision to set up shop in Delaware was Mr Murdoch's first step towards passing control of the company to his sons.",
      "It was a question Mr Murdoch chose not to answer."

      "It may seem simple, but the fact that this behavior is contagious is actually quite remarkable because very few animals do it. Yawning itself is rare in the animal kingdom, and besides people and dogs, contagious yawning has been observed only in gelada baboons, stump-tail macaques and chimpanzees.",
      "We know that humans and chimps tend to yawn more with friends and family, suggesting that catching someones yawn is tied to feelings of empathy, and past research has shown that dogs are more likely to yawn after watching familiar people yawn. However, until recently, it was unclear if dogs yawns were tied to empathy.",
      "But a recent study (http://www.springerlink.com/content/p1317t688k042x31/) conducted by researchers at Portugal's University of Porto found that dogs yawn even when they hear only the sound of a person yawning, providing the strongest evidence yet that mans best friend is able to empathize with us.",
      "The team, led by behavioral biologist Karine Silva, selected 29 dogs that had lived with their owners for at least six months. Yawn recordings of the dogs owners, an unfamiliar woman and a computer-simulation were played for the animals during two different sessions, and the study found that nearly half of the dogs yawned when they heard a recording of a human yawning. However, the canines yawned five times more often when they heard a human they knew yawning.",
      "\"These results suggest that dogs have the capacity to empathize with humans,\" said Silva, who explained that the close human-animal bond thats been developed through 15,000 years of domestication may have fostered cross-species empathy."

      "\u201cJust to make plays and help this team win and try to get us a parade down Michigan Avenue, . . . that\u2019s the mindset that I have, whether this is my last year or whether I have three years left on my contract,\u201d Tillman said, via Fred Mitchell of the Chicago Tribune. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same. We just want to win a Super Bowl. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what it is about.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I am approaching this season. [General Manager] Phil Emery made the decision to hire a new coach so this coach could take us in the direction. My role as a player is to buy into that system and do whatever I can to help this team to win a Super Bowl. I think myself and the rest of the players have bought into coach [Marc] Trestman\u2019s scheme and his system and we want to win and we want to win now. We\u2019re not in a rebuild mode. We don\u2019t have time to rebuild. We\u2019re in the winning now business. The win RIGHT now business.\u201d",

All of those deals are ones that Emery and Trestman inherited, and if the Bears don\u2019t win right now, the organization might decide to part ways with a lot of veterans.",
      "They already made one calculated business decision with linebacker Brian Urlacher this offseason, and if the results don\u2019t come, that\u2019s not a good sign for any of the long-time Bears looking for new deals."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans raised the white flag Thursday on extending domestic violence protections to gays, lesbians and transsexuals after months of resisting an expansion of the Violence Against Women Act.",
      "GOP leaders, who had tried to limit the bill before last November\u2019s election, gave the go-ahead for the House to accept a more ambitious Senate version written mainly by Democrats.",
      "Democrats, with a minority of Republicans, were key to the 286-138 House vote that sent to President Barack Obama a renewal of the 1994 law that has set the standard for how to protect women, and some men, from domestic abuse and prosecute abusers.",
      "It was the third time this year that House Speaker John Boehner has allowed Democrats and moderates in his own party to prevail over the GOP\u2019s much larger conservative wing. As with a Jan. 1 vote to avoid the fiscal cliff and legislation to extend Superstorm Sandy aid, a majority of House Republicans voted against the final anti-violence bill.",
      "Obama, in a statement, said that \u201crenewing this bill is an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear\u201d and said he would sign the bill \u201cas soon as it hits my desk.\u201d",
      "The law has been renewed twice before without controversy, but it lapsed in 2011 as it was caught up in the partisan battles that now divide Congress. Last year, the House refused to go along with a Senate-passed bill that would have made clear that lesbians, gays, immigrants and Native American women should have equal access to Violence Against Women Act programs.",
      "It appeared the scenario would be repeated this year when the House introduced a bill that didn\u2019t mention the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and watered down a Senate provision allowing tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians who attack their Indian partners on tribal lands.",
      "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., who has spent months working on the issue, defended the Republican plan: \u201cOur goal in strengthening the Violence Against Women Act is simple. We want to help all women who are faced with violent, abusive and dangerous situations. \u2026 We want them to know that those who commit these horrendous crimes will be punished.\u201d",
      "But the House proposal encountered quick and strong opposition from women\u2019s groups, the White House, Democrats and some Republicans, and on Tuesday, the GOP leadership agreed to give the House a vote on the Senate bill. It passed immediately after the House rejected Cantor\u2019s bill, 257-166, with 60 Republicans voting against it.",
      "Vice President Joe Biden, who as a senator was instrumental in moving the 1994 act through Congress, praised Cantor for not standing in the Senate bill\u2019s way. \u201cHe kept his word,\u201d Biden said.",
      "The GOP decision to step aside and let the Senate bill pass came after the party\u2019s poor showing among women in last fall\u2019s election and Democratic success in framing the debate over the Violence Against Women Act as Republican policy hostile to women. Obama won 55 percent of the women\u2019s vote last November. Republican presidential candidates haven\u2019t won the women\u2019s vote since 1984, when Ronald Reagan held a 12-point lead over Walter Mondale among women.",
      "The anti-violence bill should never have become partisan, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a sponsor of the Senate bill. \u201cThat is why I applaud moderate Republican voices in the House who stood up to their leadership to demand a vote on the Senate bill.\u201d",
      "The Senate passed its bill on a 78-22 vote with every Democrat, every woman senator and 23 of 45 Republicans supporting it.",
      "A turning point in the debate came earlier this month, when 19 Republicans, led by Rep. Jon Runyan, R-N.J., wrote a letter to their leadership urging them to accept a bipartisan plan that would reach all victims of domestic violence. The letter, Runyan said, was a catalyst in showing the leadership \u201ca willingness of people in the House to really compromise\u201d and see that the Senate \u201chas a pretty good bill.\u201d",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a Native American, also wrote his Republican colleagues saying he was voting against the House alternative because \u201cit falls short of giving tribes what they need to keep their women safe.\u201d",
      "Indian women suffer incidents of domestic violence at rates more than double national averages, but Indian courts don\u2019t have jurisdiction over non-Indians, and federal prosecutors don\u2019t take up about half the violence cases on reservations because of lack of resources to pursue crimes on isolated Indian lands. The Senate bill would give Indian courts the ability to prosecute non-Indians for a set of crimes limited to domestic violence and violations of protecting orders. Opponents have said that raises constitutional issues.",
      "\u201cWith this authority comes a serious responsibility, and tribal courts will administer justice with the same level of impartiality that any defendant is afforded in state and federal courts,\u201d said Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians.",
      "The Violence Against Women Act is credited with helping reduce domestic violence incidents by two-thirds over the past two decades. The Senate bill would authorize some $659 million a year over five years to fund current programs that provide grants for transitional housing, legal assistance, law enforcement training and hotlines.",
      "The Senate bill adds stalking to the list of crimes that make immigrants eligible for protection and authorizes programs dealing with sexual assault on college campuses and with efforts to reduce the backlog in rape kit analyses. It reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.",

      "North America is the largest PIB producing region, in which U.S. leads PIB production. In addition, North America and Europe accounted for the highest consumption. Growing demand from Asia Pacific on account of growing industrialization is expected to drive the market for PIB over the next few years. In addition, introduction and implementation of various environmental regulations regarding smoke and particulate emission levels which in turn affects efficiency of engines and other machines in automobiles and industrial units is expected to boost the global PIB market. However, at certain high temperatures, PIB is extremely unstable which may result in health hazards and explosions. This factor impacts the growth of the market in a negative manner. Development of recoverable and reusable PIB is expected to open future markets for the market.",
      "Some of the leading manufacturers of PIB include ExxonMobil, BASF Antwerpen NV, TPC Group Inc., Ineos, Lubrizol and Chevron Oronite among others.",

      "The first way to change streams is to create a new video element via Javascript, wait for it to load, then replace the current video with the new one. Unfortunately, HTML5 gives no way to prevent the original video, even when stopped, from using all available bandwidth to keep buffering as fast as it can. This starves the replacement video of network access, causing a lengthy delay when loading. It looks very nice and seamless when it finally works, but can easily result is switching video streams taking 15-30 seconds or more.",
      "The second option is to switch the pre-existing video element to a new stream. This is much faster as the original stream stops sinking bandwidth immediately, but upon loading it always starts from the beginning and in current browsers also displays the first frame, even if playback isn't started. After the load completes, then it's possible to seek forward to where the original stream started. It doesn't look as good, but it's much faster in practice.",

      "The only thing that worksThis is the one serum that actually, visibly works without any doubt. I tried it several times over the years and it had solid performance every single time. The lashes are not only growing visibly longer but also significantly thicker, in a very natural way. The only catch is that you need to keep using it for it to work. Patience is key though. I have pretty good lashes and I only begin seeing results after 2-3 weeks, closer to 3. But then you hit a point when you will be like - wow, i can really see and feel the results. I do wish the price on this were more affordable. $100 is really way too much. I recall this being cheaper in the past by the way, not sure why EA increase prices in the face of growing competition of affordable amazing products.",

OH! and don't forget to turn the light bulb all the way back in to the socket , so the light will work after you take the time to install it yourself.I had the water supply line from under the box to the water dispenser in the door and the total bill on that was one hundred thirty seven and a hand full of change.Don't be afraid to do it yourself the savings is enough on one one item to make several months payments on a new one Randy the \"Handy Man'",

      "I then threaded the new wire through the cutting grid frame starting in the center and threading right and then left. While the threading was not difficult, the wire was easily kinked. The process up to this point was only 15 minutes or so.",
      "Once it was completely threaded, I worked for a couple of hours trying to smooth and straighten the wire so that is was somewhat taut and straight enough to create symetrical ice cubes.",
      "My frustration came in pulling on the wire from the center point to each outside ending point where it was to be wrapped around the screw and the screw tightened back down. The wire was fragile enough that it would break, by the time I was finished I barely had enough wire left to touch the screw let alone hook around the screw.",
      "After 3 or four days of successful opperation, the grid quit cutting again. As I took it apart, it was obvious that the weight of the ice was enough to pull the wire, that was already too short, away from the screw. I refastened it again, but think it is unlikely to hold.",
      "If it won't hold, I would be hard pressed to purchase another wire. I may bite the bullet and purchase the entire grid mechanism with the wires already installed. Even though the cost of the entire grid mechanism is $200 more than the purchase of another wire, it may well be worth the ease of installation!",

      "The overwrought romance",
      "From its earliest moments, Twice Born shows its hand as an old-fashioned romantic tearjerker in which litanies of buried secrets will come tumbling out at a steady clip.",
      "Twice Born will benefit from Cruz\u2019s marquee value, and the film\u2019s sweeping, tragic romance could spark interest in discriminating date-night crowds. But the question remains whether a love story set during the siege of Sarajevo will prove too bleak for most viewers, who may decide to spend their entertainment dollars elsewhere.",
      "In the present day, middle-aged Gemma (Cruz) and her teen son Pietro (Pietro Castellitto) travel from Italy to Sarajevo to visit her long-time friend Gojko (Adnan Haskovic). But the reunion proves bittersweet for Gemma, who flashes back to her relationship with an American photographer, Diego (Hirsch), whom she met in Sarajevo in 1984 and married soon after. As the flashbacks flesh out their time together, Gemma finally comes to terms with how their love affair ended.",
      "From its earliest moments, Twice Born shows its hand as an old-fashioned romantic tearjerker in which litanies of buried secrets will come tumbling out at a steady clip. Subtlety isn\u2019t exactly a valued commodity in this genre, but what is important is a sense that the film\u2019s central lovers are consumed by their passion for one another.",
      "Unfortunately, though Cruz and Hirsch have strong individual moments in Twice Born , their onscreen courtship never fully convinces. When they first meet, Gemma jokes about their age difference, and one can\u2019t help but feel that Diego\u2019s boyish impetuousness seems lightweight stacked up against Gemma\u2019s sophisticated, sultry air. As a result, it\u2019s hard to see precisely why she falls for him \u2014 his exuberant manner notwithstanding, he doesn\u2019t have her intelligence or gravitas. The two actors have a decent rapport without ever feeling like lovers, even though they do share a few sex scenes.",
      "Equally hard to reconcile are a few plot points later in the film that signal the lovers\u2019 dissolution. Unable to have a child, Gemma and Diego eventually seek out an unusual solution that plays out in predictable, contrived ways, laying the groundwork for much heavy-handed sadness down the road for all concerned.",
      "Additionally, the couple\u2019s collision course with the wars in Yugoslavia ends up feeling more like a device to add a sufficiently dramatic backdrop to their love story than it is an organic complication in their relationship. Nonetheless, the couple\u2019s problems conceiving and the bloodshed in Sarajevo prove vitally important to a series of twists, shocks, misunderstandings and reconciliations that conclude the film, none of which is particularly moving since Twice Born hasn\u2019t earned the tragedy it tries to mine.",

      "She would have laughed incredulously if it had not been for the nurse who looked at her and cocked an eyebrow as to ask, \u201cLady, are you ok?\u201d. The doctor had confirmed her suspicions. She was pregnant for the second time in her life.",
      "In fact, Susan Riley wasn\u2019t ok at all. The day began badly when she tripped down the stairs in the dark, the car wouldn\u2019t start, late to work and then now- the news. It seemed to her that the day had been shot already with a quick bang before she realized what had happened. She shivered, rubbing her arms, as she sat in her green Ford Explorer in the parking lot of Ashford General Clinic. Her red-rimmed eyes noticed a patient walking out and she ducked, not wanting anyone to see her crying like a fool. There were twisted edges of Kleenex sticking out on the floor under the seat but she didn\u2019t care about the mess. A quivery sigh escaped as she tried to compose herself before calling her husband at work.",
      "She knew this would eventually happen when she would lose control of her life yet she didn\u2019t expect it to happen so soon. Susan had deliberately planned her life down to the moment. All the milestones she wanted to accomplish: marriage, great career, children, beautiful house, a good life- she did until this aberration came and ruined everything. She had no time to deal with this new development. She already had a full-time career as a wedding consultant, Kevin his, and the twins were almost done with high school. As far as she was concerned, her schedule was on track. No breakdown, Susan, you\u2019re too busy for this.",
      "Pushing that out of her mind, she dialed her husband\u2019s cell.",
      "\u201cKevin Riley of Churchill and Associates speaking.\u201d",
      "Susan paused. Should she tell him? The sound of his voice jarred her from her musings.",

      "She heard him grunt and she figured he must be looking over his papers and waiting for the phone call to end.",
      "She waited for him to say, \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d, \u201cNo way!\u201d, \u201cAnother one? Suze- I guess we could\u2026\u201d- something \u2026 anything.",

      "Busy? What about me? I\u2019m busy too! Driving the twins to practice and dealing with frantic brides and demanding mothers, the commute to her job, and the bible study group on Tuesday nights.",
      "\u201cI suppose so\u2026\u201d She heard him sigh and hang up.",
      "Susan frowned as she tossed the cell phone in her purse. She shook her head as she backed up the Explorer and drove away.",
      "After she picked the twins, Jessica and Gerry from Crestview High- she drove in silence while her teenagers chattered and bickered in the backseat. She didn\u2019t know how she could handle another child. Her stomach rumbled at the thought.",
      "Abide in Me",
      "Susan\u2019s lips drew in a grim line. She couldn\u2019t see how she could abide as long as the sinking feeling remained. She remember she had a client to meet tomorrow and she still had duties to complete. As they reached home and the twins ran in the house, Susan flung her purse on the kitchen counter and then pinched the top of her nose. The twins went upstairs to their bedrooms. The appointments in red on the calendar on the kitchen wall loomed large in her sight",
      "My grace is sufficient for you.",
      "The breath of Heaven spoke in her soul. Tender and mild like a skipping lamb in the fields.",
      "She whispered, \u201cI\u2019m not ready for this. I\u2018m only forty-five years old. Look, my calendar is full. There\u2018s no time to raise another-\u201d An urging prompted her heart and she finished- \u201cbaby\u201d.",
      "Take up my yoke, Susan.",
      "After the lasagna was baked and set on the stove to cool, Susan heard Kevin\u2019s briefcase fall with a thump to the floor. He entered the kitchen with his sleeves rolled up. She noticed new lines radiating from the corners of his eyes and dimpled brackets around his lips. Kevin\u2019s brown eyes radiated fatigue and concern. He covered the distance in few steps and pulled her in an embrace. He whispered against her forehead. She felt the Holy Spirit pour a flood of peace into her body, filling up the crevices, until she felt the strength to face their uncertain future.",

I'd just add that the basic is pretty simple build a static busybox with many \"applets\" (basic commad like dd, cp, mv, et. all) as one will need if not the whole stack so you don't bother to ask yourself what is needed for what? And then construct the root `/' of the initramfs as one would expect in basic system with bin:sbin:lib:usr:dev:sys:proc with devices nodes in dev if the init script does not take care of creating them, plus extra binaries/libraries that one may need with his/her init script of choice.",
      "And then build the compressed cpio image, and add a line in the boot loader command. That's all, nothing really complicated for a basic initramfs. And you'll find that basic structure in the forum HOWTO or in the Initramfs wiki article.",
      "Well, if we come back to our complicated init script with a few possibilities left to the user to use functionalities included in the init script that become a little complicated--as the DM-Crypt with LUKS article--depending of the functionalities included in the script, so the",
      "simple process to build a simple initramfs just vanish somewhere and the user is faced to many details related to the complicated task to do. That's where the building script comes into play and leave the user in the middle of nowhere if he/she doesn't has basic idea of how to build an initramfs. But there's nothing that complicated with what is posted on the wiki or forum, the int script is a bit long (several hundreds of lines of a POSIX sh script), that's all. Did you even try to read Arch initramfs' building script? That one is complicated because it is intended to adress everything without requiring the user anything but a few configurations options.",

      "What did Lone Star Dietz do between early February of 1920, the time he left the Spokane, Washington jail after completing his 30-day incarceration, and late March 1921, when he signed with Purdue to coach their football team?",
      "Dietz was broke in late 1919 after investing heavily in Washington Motion Picture Company. Having no money for his legal defense forced him to plead nolo contender to the draft-dodging retrial after the first one produced a hung jury locked at 8 to 4 for acquittal. An apparently sympathetic district attorney agreed to the wrist slap sentence in the county jail instead of a long one in a federal penitentiary like those given to others in the post-WWI hysteria. The news article announcing his release stated that he had been a \u201ctrusty\u201d the last two weeks of his incarceration that began on January 8, 1920.",
      "One can easily envision the affable Dietz playing cards with his jailers a la Rhett Butler\u2014except that he had no money to gamble with. What he did afterwards is still unclear. Newspaper articles covering his release his release made no mention of his plans for the immediate future. He may have promoted Fools Gold , the movie he played a role in and helped fund, but that would have required finances on which to live. Another possibility is that he did movie work in Hollywood. He had experience and could have acted or done stunt work or various things behind the camera. That would have been a way for him to earn a paycheck. Football was out of season, so that wasn\u2019t a possibility.",
      "The Encyclopedia of Football, 15 by Roger Treat listed Dietz as having played guard for the Hammond Pros NFL team. At 36, Dietz would have been old, and likely too out of shape to play much. However, it would have brought him east and more available for other opportunities.",
      "The November 12, 1920 edition of The Evergreen , Washington State College\u2019s school newspaper, listed \u201cVeteran Cougar Coaches.\u201d According to this piece, Dietz was \u201cNow engaged in theatrical business in New York.\u201d A January 10, 1921 article in The Seattle Star titled \u201c\u2018Lonestar\u2019 Dietz Playing Behind N. Y. Footlights\u201d had him \u201c\u2026playing behind the footlights in Woodward\u2019s New York theatre.\u201d",
      "I have been unable to find out anything about Mr. Woodward or his theater. Any help in that regard would be most appreciated.",
      "The March 229, 1921 edition of The Lafayette Journal Courier announced the hiring of Lone Star Dietz to lead Purdue\u2019s varsity football team. That article also said that \u201c\u2026for the last two years he has been engaged in business activities on the west coast.\u201d",
      "Clearly, more information is needed to determine exactly what Dietz had occupied himself doing those thirteen-plus months between jail and Purdue football.",

      "The author of the article I referred to in the previous message, Jim Kerschner, forwarded a link to the entire article. The article, when read in full, provided me with more information than my question about his Vaudeville career. Perhaps a little background is needed for those unfamiliar with the multi-talented Mr. Dietz. Prior to arriving in the Pacific Northwest in September 1915, he had worked as an artist illustrating Macalaster College publications, creating a mural out of grains grown at Chilocco Indian School for the Model Government Indian School Exhibit at the St. Louis World\u2019s Fair, played of football teams at Macalaster College, Friends University and Carlisle Indian School, competed on the indigenous people\u2019s team in the Anthropology Days event tacked onto the 1904 Olympic Games held at the St. Louis World\u2019s Fair. He sang solos at Friends University and performed a war dance at the School of Industrial Art of the Philadelphia Museum (today\u2019s University of the Arts), after which he gave a talk in what the Philadelphia Record described as \u201cexcellent English style, which might put an ordinary Philadelphian to the blush.\u201d",
      "In addition to serving as an assistant coach to Pop Warner and teaching art at Carlisle, he illustrated their literary magazine and ephemera. He and his first wife, the noted Winnebago artist Angel DeCora, also raised prize-winning Russian Wolfhounds in a kennel behind their apartment on Carlisle Barracks.",
      "At Washington State College, in addition to coaching the football team, Dietz arranged songs and sang baritone while touring the state with the college\u2019s chorus. He also gave talks to classes on topics such as architecture. Prior to arriving in Pasadena for the 1916 Rose Bowl, he arranged for his team to portray the football team in Tom Brown at Harvard and for a small role in the picture for himself. When his team returned to Pullman after the victory, he stayed on in Hollywood to arrange more picture work for himself.",
      "The article Mr. Kerschner referred to in his piece listed three films Dietz had been in, one of which I hadn\u2019t heard of before, The Love Hermit. It also credited him with writing the story for Lonestar, but couldn\u2019t appear in the movie because it was filmed during football season.",
      "The article also provides some information about Dietz\u2019s Vaudeville career: \u201cThe rapid progress that is being made by your company here in Spokane toward the production of motion pictures has made me willing to change from my previously announced plan to spend the coming year on the vaudeville circuit.\u201d More research is required to uncover exactly which talents he would have employed in his act.",
      "Now to figure out how to search News.Google.com for articles not on-line when I spent numerous hours hunched over microfilm reading machines.",

      "While I wait on galleys for my Craighead book, I have received requests for interviews about Carlisle Indian School football players. The first was with the local paper to talk about the 100 th anniversary of the 1916 Rose Bowl. The second is for a videotaped interview about the Carlisle Indian School football program for an upcoming documentary by Ernie Zahn, a Current Fellow with Filmmakers Without Borders. In the meantime, Washington State Magazine, the Washington State University alumni magazine published a short article they requested I write about the 1916 Rose Bowl. How, you might ask, is the 1916 Rose Bowl a Carlisle Indian School topic?",
      "Lone Star Dietz played right tackle for Pop Warner\u2019s legendary 1909-11 teams and became his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 when he assisted the \u201cOld Fox\u201d coach the Carlisle teams from 1912 to 1914. After Warner took the head coaching job at Pitt, he recommended Dietz to head up the floundering Washington State program. Dietz brought Warner\u2019s single- and double-wing formations to the Palouse and ran roughshod over the competition with them. A photo of the 1915 Washington State College team lined up in an unbalanced-right single-wing formation heads the Washington State Magazine article.",
      "The Carlisle Sentinel interview resulted in an article in the December 26 edition titled \u201cRose Bowl: Lone Star Dietz coached first game in Rose Bowl Series.\u201d Accompanying the article are two photos of Dietz: one in civilian clothes holding a cigar, the other in a Carlisle football uniform.",
      "How much of the hour-long interview by the Filmmakers Without Borders fellow won\u2019t be known for some time but the entire documentary Zahn intends to produce will be short. Because it is funded, he won\u2019t be entering it in festivals or contests. Instead, he will be putting it up on YouTube.com when post-production work is complete.",

      "Yesterday\u2019s edition of Indian Country Today includes an article by Jack McNeel on Lone Star Dietz. The headline, which probably wasn\u2019t written by Mr. McNeel, understandably focuses on Dietz\u2019s posthumous induction recently into the College Football Hall of Fame. But the article covers more than that. He covered as much of Dietz\u2019s highly eventful life as space would allow.",
      "Something I particularly like is that McNeely chose to use a photograph of Dietz with the Washington State team that isn\u2019t widely used. It\u2019s nice to see something you haven\u2019t seen before. In this case, I probably saw it briefly when going through the Washington State photo archives some years ago but didn\u2019t remember seeing it.",
      "There are a few things in the article that need a little bit of clarification. First, Tournament of Roses wasn\u2019t arranging its annual football game in the fall of 1915 because they had only hosted a game once before and that was back in 1902. The Washington State victory over Brown in 1916 was what established the game as an annual event and much of the credit for that goes to Lone Star Dietz for putting West Coast football on the same level as the eastern powers.",
      "The statement, \u201cSoon after, many college sports were suspended for World War I,\u201d may compress the timeframe too much for readers unaware of what happened during that period. Dietz\u2019s men lost two games in 1916 and were undefeated again in 1917 but weren\u2019t invited to Pasadena because of the popularity of military teams. It was after the 1917 season that college sports were curtailed freeing Dietz to coach many of his former players on the Mare Island Marines team.",
      "The phrase \u201cIndian agent from the Sioux Nation\u201d may be misleading and cause unfamiliar readers to think the agent was an Indian. The agent was a white man assigned to the Pine Ridge Agency, one of several reservations on which Sioux live.",
      "\u201cBenjey\u2019s research indicates that Dietz\u2019s father took the dead baby\u2026\u201d would more accurately be phrased, Benjey\u2019s research indicates that Dietz\u2019s father claimed to have taken the dead baby\u2026. However, W. W. Deitz (he spelled his name differently that Lone Star spelled it) denied that publicly.",

      "A combination of beastly hot weather that drained my energy coupled with being overwhelmed with work to get out has kept me away from my blog recently. I hope things let up for the rest of the summer.",
      "Yesterday, I received a question regarding when the Washington State teams were first called Cougars. That person wanted to know if the 1918 Spalding\u2019s Guide referred to the 1917 WSC as Cougars. It didn\u2019t, but didn\u2019t call most teams by their nicknames, either.",
      "Washington State lore places the origin of the use of that name for their teams to an unnamed Bay Area sportswriter who wrote that the WSC team \u201cplayed like Cougars\u201d in their October 25, 1919 game with Cal, the second game played under Gus Welch\u2019s leadership. A quick scan of newspapers of that time uncovered a short article in the October 25, 1919 Oakland Tribune stated \u201cWashington State College, the Cougars, meets the University of California here today\u2026.\u201d The post-game coverage written by Doug Montell did not use Cougars or any other nickname for the WSC team although it did refer to the California team as the Bears. Even if Montell had called them Cougars, the WSC team couldn\u2019t have been dubbed with that name for its play against Cal because some unnamed person at the Oakland Tribune called them that before the game was played. Regardless, this wasn\u2019t the first time a college team in the state of Washington took that name.",
      "The March 17, 1918 edition of the Oakland Tribune (yes, it was that same paper again) included an anonymous piece stating that the University of Washington had officially named its teams Cougars. So, a year and a half before the Tribune called the WSC team Cougars, it claimed that Washington had claimed the name. Perhaps someone in the Tribune \u2019s sports department had a feline fetish.",

      "Tonight, the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in Washington, DC holds a reception to kick off its new exhibit, \u201cBest in the World: Native Athletes in the Olympics,\u201d to celebrate the athletic achievements of Native Americans on the 100 th anniversary of the 1912 Stockholm Games that featured legendary performances by Jim Thorpe and Lewis Tewanima. I am attending because Bob Wheeler, Jim Thorpe\u2019s Boswell, is to speak there. While making preparations for attending this event, I received some unexpected news.",
      "The National Football Foundation (NFF) released its selections for induction in the College Football Hall of Fame Class of 2012 and Lone Star Dietz was finally on the list. As blog followers probably know, Greg and John Witter, first cousins and rabid Washington State football fans, and I campaigned to get Dietz placed on the Hall of Fame ballot some years ago. Getting his won-loss record corrected was the key to getting him nominated but there were larger obstacles yet to come.",
      "Lone Star Dietz died in 1964 and there are few people still alive that knew him. Also, he coached at schools with smaller alumni bases and less clout than the major football factories. Washington State, for example, couldn\u2019t muster the support for him that, say, Ohio State could for John Cooper or Michigan could for Lloyd Carr. While both these recent coaches had very good careers, neither had the impact on the history of the game as did Dietz. It\u2019s one thing to inherit a strong program and be a good steward, but it is quite another to rebuild a floundering program from the ground up, something that Lone Star did multiple times.",
      "The closest he came was in 2006 when the selectors chose Bobby Bowden and Joe Paterno instead of the people who were on the ballot. A couple of years ago, when Lone Star\u2019s name was dropped from the ballot, I gave up all hope of him ever being selected. I didn\u2019t even know that his name was on the Divisional ballot this year, so was shocked when I started receiving phone calls from reporters on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "All I can say is that it\u2019s long overdue. Although he\u2019s being brought in through the back door, so to speak, he will finally be in. He\u2019s the first Carlisle Indian to be inducted as a coach; the rest were as players. Whether this honor is enough to offset the many indignities Dietz suffered and mollify the Lone Star Curse is yet to be seen.",

      "I thought I\u2019d continue with the theme of Carlisle Indians who played football in WWI by looking through the 1919 Spalding Guide for references to the Carlisle team or its players. Before starting that, I checked to make sure that I hadn\u2019t done it before as my memory isn\u2019t as good as it once was. In January of this year, I did a piece about the Carlisle students whose names I wasn\u2019t familiar with who were playing on military teams. I recollect having mentioned that, although the 1918 Spalding Guide included Carlisle\u2019s schedule for that year, none of these games were played because the school was closed shortly before the beginning of the football season in 1918. Fortunately, some names I do recognize can be found in the 1919 book, too.",
      "Om page 22 is the photograph of the 1918 Georgia Tech \u201cGolden Tornado.\u201d Joe Guyon is #8 and John Heisman is #12. Charles Guyon (Wahoo) isn\u2019t in the photo. Perhaps, Heisman got rid of him by then. Page 188 displays headshots of players and coaches for the 1918 Mare Island Marines team. Lone Star Dietz, #3, coached this team composed mainly of his former Washington State players. So may of them were on this team that this photo was published as part of the Washington State yearbook for that year. The New Year\u2019s Day game in Pasadena on January 1, 1919 was the second one for those who had also been on the 1915 Washington State squad that had played in Pasadena in 1916.",
      "Page 263 includes a write up for the Base Section No. 5 team from Brest, a major port of embarkation: \u201cOn January 19, 1919, a Base foot ball squad was organized under Lieut. W. C. Collyer, former Cornell half-back. This squad was composed of the above mentioned engineers, together with several stars gathered together from different outfits. Of these, the most prominent was Artichoke, a former Haskell and Carlisle Indian star.\u201d Not being aware of anyone named Artichoke, I am confident that the player in question was Chauncey Archiquette, Jim Thorpe\u2019s early idol. Unfortunately, a team photo wasn\u2019t included to see that Artichoke was indeed Archiquette.",

      "Page 110 includes headshots of soldiers who played on the Camp Funston (Fort Riley, Kansas) football team in 1917. Number 29 is Pvt. Thomas Hawkeagle (aka Pretty Boy and Hawk Eagle). Nothing further could be found about him in the book but it is well known that he played on the 1914 Carlisle team and distinguished himself so much against Auburn that he figures prominently in the legends of the origin of the War Eagle cheer. Hawkeagle was the last Carlisle player mentioned in the 1918 Spalding Guide for activity in the 1917 season. There were likely others but they weren\u2019t mention by Spalding or I just missed them. John Flinchum was listed on page 224 as the captain of the 1918 team, playing at left tackle. No coach was listed for 1918 because none had been hired at that point.",
      "Non-players in the form of officials were listed in the back of the book on pages 233 through 249. Officials were separated into various groups: collegiate, service and scholastic, as well as by region, state or conference. Southern Officials were grouped by white and colored. Even the officials that were set apart as being active-duty military had this separation even though the Service Officials did not. Indians were not segregated from other officials as Indian players had been allowed to play on otherwise all-white teams for many years. Oddly, only one former Carlisle player was listed as an official and that was Mike Balenti.",
      "The advertisement for Warner\u2019s 1912 book was still being run in the 1918 guide. This time, it included an anonymous testimonial for \u201cThe coach of an unbeaten Western college\u201d who was surely Lone Star Dietz whose Washington State team had gone unbeaten in 1917. Dietz\u2019s team was not invited to the Rose Bowl that year because military teams were drawing large crowds at that time. Dietz and his players would be invited at the end of the 1918 season but that time they wore Mare Island Marine uniforms.",

      "In a discussion on Amazon.com of his biography of \u201cGloomy\u201d Gil Dobie, William L. Borland, states that the University of Washington was offered the opportunity to defend the honor of the West and turned it down prior to it being offered to Washington State. UW\u2019s account differs with that told by WSC. When asked where he found the information to support the claim, Borland responded that he found it in Seattle newspapers of the day. I have seen letters on Tournament of Roses letterhead to Washington State and to Brown University confirming that they would be playing each other on January 1, 1916, but I haven\u2019t seen anything from the Tournament to UW. Research in Tournament of Roses and UW archives will be necessary to determine the truth. However, not finding anything in either archive does not mean that documents never existed, just that the institutions didn\u2019t save them or that someone stole them from the archives. The latter happens more often than we\u2019d like to admit.",
      "It will be some time before I have the opportunity to do research at either institution, so basic newspaper searches will have to do for now. I do recall that an early report out of Providence stated that Brown would be playing the University of Washington. Prior to this, I thought that a reporter was confused. A quick search of an on-line newspaper archive found a November 10, 1915 article in The Bakersfield Californian that included the following:",
      "\u201cThe undefeated University of Washington football eleven probably will be seen in action at Pasadena New Year\u2019s Day, according to plans learned in Los Angeles yesterday. The Pasadena Chamber of Commerce has invited Coach Gilmour Dobie\u2019s aggregation to meet one of the strongest eastern varsities at Pasadena January 1, and Washington is expected to accept the offer\u2026.Faculty permission is all that is needed, according to [Graduate Manager Arthur] Younger\u2026.Pasadena may bring Michigan out for the contest with Washington. However, as Michigan has been losing steadily it is believed that another school will be selected.\u201d",

      "When addressing the incorrect assertion that Pop Warner had developed the single-wing formation while he was coaching at Pitt and Stanford in the 1920s by www.footballhistorian.com, I neglected to include a piece of evidence that demonstrates this statement is patently false.",
      "Below is a photograph of the 1915 Washington State College team lined up in an unbalanced-line single wing formation. The photo can be found on page 79 of Richard Fry\u2019s beautiful book, The Crimson and the Gray: 100 Years with the WSU Cougars, which has unfortunately gone out of print. (Something needs to be done about that.) The identities of the players, uniforms and helmets accurately date the photo. Lone Star Dietz, a single-wing aficionado, coached WSC for the 1915-17 seasons, so it is logical that his team would run it and the double-wing.",
      "Dietz played on the Carlisle Indian School teams from 1909-11, then assisted Pop Warner from 1912-14. After the end of the 1914 season, Warner and Dietz headed to greener pastures. Warner took the head coaching job at Pitt and Dietz caught the train to Pullman.",
      "If Warner hadn\u2019t developed the single-wing at Carlisle as he said, this photo would mean that Lone Star came up with it on his own and never took credit for it, which is highly unlikely. Some of the confusion may be of Warner\u2019s making.",
      "Pop\u2019s correspondence course (1908-11) and his first coaching book (1912) do not include this formation; they show earlier evolutions with balanced lines. The formation in the photo is the one Warner calls Formation A in his 1927 book. He likely held back his best stuff in his earlier publications because it is doubtful that Dietz would have been running the unbalanced-line single-wing as a primary formation in 1915 had it not been perfected used at Carlisle some years before.",

When a wealthy business man threatens to develop The Mob's historic neighborhood and displace thousands-of people, Emily must work together with Sean and The Mob to turn their performance art into protest art, and risk losing their dreams to fight for a greater cause.Written by",

      "I am shedding my weird, creepy hoody that I hide out with and telling everyone that I am a fan of the Step Up franchise. Yes I'm a little embarrassed and honestly I'm not saying the movies are good but as far as guilty pleasures go they are absolutely divine. With the exception of the first installment which although starred a young sexy Channing Tatum in his first lead role took it self way too seriously to be entertaining. And thats a huge reason why these films work because from it's superior sequel, best of the franchise and one of the best dance movies ever made Step Up 2 The Streets the movies have found this odd balance off fiery kinetic dancing, likable personalities, overly melodramatic and unintentionally funny performances, ferocious cinematography and hammy storytelling that just works. You laugh, you clap and sometimes you tear up at the clich\u00e9d and expected finale. This entry fares better than the last which was still pretty damn good. It centers on \"The Mob\" a dance group of struggling artists looking to make their mark on pop culture by staging creative dance mobs so that they can get 10,000,000 views on you tube and get a hefty $100,000 prize. (which split between the 50 person team isn't very much but I'll let it pass). Anyways he comes in contact with another struggling young dancer whose well not very struggling since her Daddy is a billionaire whose looking to tear down the middle/poor class neighborhood they live in and make it into a huge resort. Enter the film's interestingly semi fleshed out plot as they decide to change their flash mobs from breezy dance numbers to ones with meaning as they protest \"The Man\" so to speak. Of course their is some third act drama to cause a downward spiral before wrapping it up in the films inspired finale which was in fact inspired by the classic film The Warriors. The dancing is amazing and for the first time in the series they incorporate different styles of dance such as contemporary and modern to successfully winning measures. Kathryn McCormick of So you think you can dance has some crazy sizzle in the lead when it comes to her dancing but her acting is well questionable in the essence of I'm not actually sure that's what she's doing. Slightly more successful and way hotter is MMA fighter Ryan Guzman as the film's thankfully mostly shirtless leading man. He's got the body of a Greek god and the talent when it comes to dancing but hey let's just leave the acting out of this equation. You know there's a problem when the film's best performance dramatically is from Peter Gallagher as her over bearing, greedy Father. And watching the two of them together trying to force some type of connection is akin to watching erasers on a desk facing each other. That being said they are hot and very talented when dancing. And when they are it's fire. And thats basically the film as with the other installments when they try for the drama it's unintentionally funny and it works in a so bad it's good way but when they perform you see the kinetic, addictive energy that makes these films so endearing. 4/5",

Kathryn McCormick of So you think you can dance has some crazy sizzle in the lead when it comes to her dancing but her acting is well questionable in the essence of I'm not actually sure that's what she's doing. Slightly more successful and way hotter is MMA fighter Ryan Guzman as the film's thankfully mostly shirtless leading man. He's got the body of a Greek god and the talent when it comes to dancing but hey let's just leave the acting out of this equation. You know there's a problem when the film's best performance dramatically is from Peter Gallagher as her over bearing, greedy Father. And watching the two of them together trying to force some type of connection is akin to watching erasers on a desk facing each other. That being said they are hot and very talented when dancing. And when they are it's fire. And thats basically the film as with the other installments when they try for the drama it's unintentionally funny and it works in a so bad it's good way but when they perform you see the kinetic, addictive energy that makes these films so endearing. 4/5"

      "The amount contractors pay for a range of key construction materials held steady in September in the United States but climbed 8.1 percent from the year-earlier level, according to an analysis of producer price index figures released by the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC).",
      "Meanwhile, the price contractors charge for new nonresidential building construction edged up only two to three percent over 12 months, depending on building type, AGC reports.",
      "\u201cFeeble demand for construction is forcing contractors to absorb the bulk of materials price hikes, instead of passing them along to owners,\u201d Ken Simonson, the association\u2019s chief economist, said in a written statement. \u201cThis pattern has persisted for more than two years, and many contractors are increasingly at risk of going under.\u201d",
      "Simonson noted that key materials showed divergent price trends in September but all posted double-digit year-over-year increases. Those materials include diesel fuel, which was up 3.3 percent for the month and 39.4 percent since September 2010; copper and brass mills shapes, down 0.7 percent in September but up 14.8 percent over 12 months; steel mill products, which slipped 0.6 percent for the month but rose 13.5 percent for the year; and aluminum mill shapes, down 1.8 percent for the month but up 10.4 percent from a year earlier.",
      "\u201cThese prices can spike anytime there is a global supply disruption or a consensus that demand is strengthening worldwide, not just from U.S. construction,\u201d Simonson said. \u201cIn contrast, materials produced here and used only by U.S. construction have shown little price movement.\u201d",
      "He cited, as examples, the producer price indexes for concrete products, up 0.2 percent in September and 0.3 percent over 12 months; lumber and plywood, down 1.3 percent for the month and 0.4 percent for the year; and gypsum products such as wallboard, down 1.7 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively.",
      "Simonson observed that the price index for new construction (what contractors charge for construction projects) rose 2.2 percent over 12 months for industrial buildings, 2.6 percent for offices, 2.8 percent for warehouses and three percent for schools.",
      "\u201cIn light of the much steeper materials cost increases, these gains are not enough to keep contractors solvent,\u201d he warned.",
      "Association officials said that in addition to the cost squeeze, the construction industry was suffering from decreasing demand for public sector construction activity. They said that while state and local construction budgets will continue to contract for the foreseeable future, Washington could help offset some of the decline by enacting legislation to make needed, long-term investments in highways, transit systems, clean water systems, airports and runways.",
      "\u201cGiven the stagnant construction bid prices, taxpayers stand to benefit if Washington acts quickly to enact new infrastructure investments,\u201d said AGC CEO Stephen E. Sandherr. \u201cEven if construction prices rebound in the near future, it is still a lot less expensive to maintain infrastructure while it is operating than to fix it once it breaks.\u201d",

En un recorrido que dei con mi esposa por todo el hotel, notamos que hace falta una inversion ya que como les comente tiene una gran infraestructura, ya que tiene un salon grande como de baile o restaurante con una gran vista, tambien un restaurante en la parte de la alberca con un bar el cual tampoco funciona, y unas fuentes hermosas sobre los recorridos hacia las Villas (habitaciones). En fin si alguien tiene dudas del hotel o requiere fotos de el con gusto se las mandare a su correo. Mi correo es : alejandro-padilla@hotmail.com\u2026",
      "Stayed at La Marina as a first timer in Acapulco. The hotel was selected for me due to its proximity to the friend that I was visiting. All in all, the hotel is a more than adequate accomodation. The room that I stayed in (202) has a stunning view of the bay and the city and was very quiet. The room is sparsely decorated and furnished, but every thing was in good repair (well the bathroom sink was a bit slow draining....). The room has a covered patio with a table and chairs and the view. The grounds of the hotel are very nicely landscaped with flowers and trees and there is off-street parking. The rooms stairstep up the hillside of the complex. It is a relatively short (15 min) walk to Caletta beach and probably a bit longer up the hill and over to La Quebrada and the divers. The hotel was not very busy during the four days I stayed, which suited me fine. Drawbacks may include the fact that the hotel isn't located near a restaurant or nightlife, but the buses and taxies whizzing by can easily take you to the Zocalo and the Costera in a jiffy. Also, be prepared to haul your bags over the brick patio and up the brick stairs. You can probably get someone to move them to your room, but I didn't notice a large staff. I did notice by the signage that it is/was a Hyatt hotel. However, they don't appear to be putting much money into it as the spa and restaurant were closed during my visit. Perhaps they operate during busier times. All in all, a fine hotel well landscaped and quiet with a wonderful view of the bay. I will most certainly return. \u2026",
      "We found a beautiful hotel but had a terrible experience. Money was stolen out of the hotel's safety deposit box (we were not the only ones) & then we were called liars & were threatened by the manager & asked to leave because we were upset. The owner asked us to stay but we never felt safe the rest of our stay. What a waste of a beautiful property.",

On shares' last attempt at that resistance level earlier this year, excess supply swatted down shares again. But this time could be different thanks to the considerable buying pressure that's behind shares.

Luckily for SJM investors, shares appear to have already reached their price objective for the breakdown, but I'd be skeptical of this stock's trading for the next few sessions.

But VRA guided lower for both second quarter and fiscal year earnings numbers, a fact that's spooked investors who've already been pretty beaten down over the course of the year.",
      "Today's double-digit decline in VRA is ugly, but at least it puts shares back down at $20 support. If VRA can still catch a bid at that $20 level, I'd expect to see some semblance of a correction in the next week as buyers step up to the plate.

      "Here we present a technique for segmenting matches into spatio-temporally defined components referred to as encounters, enabling performance analysis.We apply encounter-based analysis to match data from the popular eSport game DOTA, and present win probability predictions based on encounters. Finally, metrics for evaluating team performance during match runtime are proposed.",
      "What is Esports?",
      "As many avid gamers know there are a wide variety of esports, i.e. Call Of Duty, Overwatch, League Of Legends (LoL), Dota and Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO for short) and the newest being Fortnite, with the most watched Esport being CSGO reeling in a large 7.9 million hours watched as of December 2018 with Dota 2 coming second only by the thousands!",
      "It\u2019s safe to say since the \u2018Space Invaders\u2019 Championship held by Atari attracting more than 10,000 participants across the United States in 1980, we\u2019ve definitely come a very long way.",
      "So with that being said let\u2019s talk about the money involved within eSports, prize pools for eSports haven\u2019t always been what they are now, as of 2018 the prize pool for the massive Internationals of LoL where all the big guns come out, teams like \u2018Invictus\u2019 (the champions of 2018) \u2018Fnatic\u2019 and \u2018Cloud9\u2019 were competing for a ridiculous $25,532,177.00, but let\u2019s go back a few years to 2011 with the first ever League Of Legends World Championship the prize pool in those days were $100,000 with $50,000 going to the winners Fnatic, $25,000 to Against all authority, $10,000 to Team SoloMid (TSM) and so on and so forth.",
      "While most competitive players tend to train off camera, a lot tend to stream on Twitch. Twitch is used by some of the biggest streamers at their respective game, some of the biggest streamers that also play competitively in their game, you may recognize some of the most popular being \u201cFaker\u201d, who is a South Korean professional League of Legends player who is considered by many to be the best League of Legends player of all time. Formerly known as \u201cGoJeonPa\u201d on the Korean server, he was picked up by SK Telecom in 2013 and is currently the mid laner for SK Telecom T1 and the big personality and twitch streamer Optic Scump one of the \u2018Old Timers\u2019 you could say in esports having over 8 years of experience in the art of esports.",
      "All teams have a view to where they would want to be where they see themselves in 5 years for example here are some of my personal picks to be massive teams in the near future in COD which I believe as an esport Call Of Duty is growing and growing competing with the likes of League of legends and Dota.",
      "Luminosity Gaming: With a 4th place finish in the most recent Black ops 4 Competition LG have really come into their own since forming in 2015 their highest finish in the past being a 1st in the CWL Anahiem open in 2017 copping a massive prize pool of $80,000 for the team",

      "Johnathan \u2018John\u2019 Perez: since coming back from a short stay in Envy, you could tell John had some much enthusiasm to get to the very top finally finding a team he can call home after bouncing for team to team, little known fact John placed 3rd at the 2017 CWL Atlanta Open while competing with a broken middle finger.",
      "Matthew \u2018FormaL\u2019 Piper: Now in my opinion formal is the most recognisable Slayer in the game coming from Optic we all know how much of a beast this guy is, in his first tournament in the sky blue that is LG they finished 2nd place to a very strong Enigma6 losing 3-1. Little known fact FormaL has 20 Major championship wins.",
      "Peirce \u2018Gunless\u2019 Hillman: also a very new member to the blues coming from rise nation in October of 2018, Gunless has the role of Flex and plays extremely well at AR and SMG respectively, Gunless came in 2nd place in the ELeague on Team \u2018NAMELESS\u2019 finished on a 5-5 record and losing out to team MerK who finished 6-3. Little known fact Gunless was awarded the MVP at the 2018 CWL Seattle Open playing for Rise Nation.",
      "Nicholas \u2018Classic\u2019 DiCostanzo: Classic has been a big-time player everywhere he goes, I remember when he started and was slaying as if he was on private match playing bots while he was a member of FaZe and he never slowed up since! Classic came 4th in the first major event for LG at the CWL Las Vegas 2019 securing $20,000 with the team.",
      "Splyce (COD): Splyce have become stronger and stronger through the forming of the team in 2015 and being an EU team, Splyce are now a big powerhouse of a team picking up some big players through the years they are now a North American based team, their best placement being 1st at CWL Global Pro League 2017 Stage 1 securing the bag with a massive $212,500 going to Splyce as they beat LG in a close 3-2 score line with Bance being their MVP throughout the tournament Bance has recently left the team for Red Reserve.",
      "Jordan \u2018Jurd\u2019 Crowley: Jurd, Starting off in a team named 4Kings playing as the prime flex role which he has took with him through two stints with Epsilon where he is in the Epsilon Hall Of Fame for the going to TCM, Envy and then ending up in Splyce where he has really found his rhythm and provides a different dynamic ( and accent) to the team coming from Europe and carrying a European kinf of play which too a lot of people can be a slow methodical approach little known fact, Jurd competed with Team EnVyUs on loan from TCM-Gaming at the MLG World Finals 2015 where he placed fourth.",
      "Lamar \u2018Accuracy\u2019 Abedi: Accuracy, the teams AR Slayer is one of the newest to the team coming from teams such as Team Kaliber and EUnited Accuracy finished in 1st with TK in the CWL Pro League 2018 Stage 2 winning a huge $212,500 with the team, and has continued his success for Splyce coming 3rd twice in the Black Ops 4 era with Splyce.",

Loony finished his best personal performance with a 1.16 Kill to Death Ratio and a kill average of 25.15 Per game this was at the 2014 MLG COD League season three with Rise Nation placing 2nd .",
      "Ulysses \u2018AquA\u2019 Silva: AquA, in my opinion is one of the big time players in the leagueHe has placed top 4 at every Call of Duty Championship he\u2019s attended (2nd in 2015, 3rd in 2016, and 4th in 2017)apart from 2018 where Echo Fox, the team he was in, underperformed massively. AquA has jumped ship quite often but his performance has not changed throughout, he can really be the anchor for this team and I believe he can become one of the greatest if he finds the right team.",
      "Donovan \u2018Temp\u2019 Laroda: Temp is a Flex Player for Splyce. Temp joined the team in October 2018 and is one of the newest with Accuracy, Temp had his best Call of Duty Performance in Advanced Warfare with Denial Esports (Now Disbanded as of 2017) with 7 tournament wins and 7 seconds, coming 2nd in the MLG World Finals to the world famous Optic Gaming losing 4-1.

Unfortunately, HTML5 gives no way to prevent the original video, even when stopped, from using all available bandwidth to keep buffering as fast as it can. This starves the replacement video of network access, causing a lengthy delay when loading. It looks very nice and seamless when it finally works, but can easily result is switching video streams taking 15-30 seconds or more.",
      "The second option is to switch the pre-existing video element to a new stream. This is much faster as the original stream stops sinking bandwidth immediately, but upon loading it always starts from the beginning and in current browsers also displays the first frame, even if playback isn't started.

I'd just add that the basic is pretty simple build a static busybox with many \"applets\" (basic commad like dd, cp, mv, et. all) as one will need if not the whole stack so you don't bother to ask yourself what is needed for what? And then construct the root `/' of the initramfs as one would expect in basic system with bin:sbin:lib:usr:dev:sys:proc with devices nodes in dev if the init script does not take care of creating them, plus extra binaries/libraries that one may need with his/her init script of choice.",

That's where the building script comes into play and leave the user in the middle of nowhere if he/she doesn't has basic idea of how to build an initramfs. But there's nothing that complicated with what is posted on the wiki or forum, the int script is a bit long (several hundreds of lines of a POSIX sh script), that's all. Did you even try to read Arch initramfs' building script? That one is complicated because it is intended to adress everything without requiring the user anything but a few configurations options.",

      "Berne senior center roof question settled",
      "Quotes from two of five contractors selected by Berne City Council to take part in the bidding process for a roof replacement project at the South Adams Senior Center have been deemed \"non-responsive\" and will not be accepted.",
      "Meeting in special session at 7 a.m. Thursday, city council members sided with a legal opinion offered by City Attorney Jim Beitler that quotes from Amstutz Construction and Marquis Builders should not be accepted after representatives from those two companies failed to attend a mandatory meeting for prospective bidders last month.",
      "Five area contractors were selected in August by the city council to submit sealed quotes for the roof project. In addition to Amstutz and Maquis Builders, the council selected T.M.E., Joe H. Schwartz and Limberlost Construction as prospective bidders.",
      "Included in the quote packages furnished to those five firms, Beitler said during Thursday morning's special meeting, was a letter explaining that attendance by the companies' owners or representatives at an Aug. 31 pre-quote meeting was mandatory. The Amstutz and Marquis firms failed to have representatives at that meeting.",
      "\"We are required to award the contract to the lowest responsive and responsible quoter,\" Beitler told members of the Berne Board of Public Works and Safety during a brief meeting that preceded Thursday's special council session. \"In my legal opinion, because the letter to bidders stated that they were required \u2014 a mandatory statement \u2014 to have a representative in attendance at the pre-quote meeting, I believe those quotes are not responsive.\"",
      "The attorney cited existing Indiana case law in offering his legal opinion and said the city \"could face a legal challenge\" if the quote is awarded to a non-responsive bidder.",
      "Beitler said the options available to the council were to accept the three responsive quotes for the roof project or to \"reject all quotes and start the process over, and I'm not sure that (second option) is fair.\"",
      "Mark Wynn, owner of Marquis Builders and a member of Berne City Council, spoke briefly at the Board of Public Works meeting to say he supported whatever action the board and the city council deemed appropriate.",
      "\"I 100 percent did not catch that the meeting was mandatory or I probably would have been there,\" Wynn said. \"But I do feel a little conflict of interest in bidding on a project of this magnitude, and I'm totally fine if the process goes forward without us.\"",
      "The Board of Public Works voted 3-0 \u2014 and minutes later the entire Berne City Council voted 5-0 \u2014 to proceed with three quotes for the senior center roof project. Those bids will be opened next Monday.",
      "The council in July approved the execution of a 10-year lease with the South Adams Seniors Inc. organization for continued operation of the city\u2019s senior center. The lease agreement calls for the city to continue to lease the structure at 825 Hendricks Street to the senior center board for $1 annually, and also calls for the seniors\u2019 group to financially assist the city in making structural improvements at the site.",
      "The lease agreement came on the heels of what City Attorney Jim Beitler called a \u201csubstantial\u201d financial contribution to city by South Adams Seniors Inc. to assist in a roof repair project that has been debated by city officials for more than a year.",
      "\u201cThis agreement gives a fair amount of financial relief to the city, as it pertains to the senior center roof,\u201d McKean said earlier in the process. \u201cThe seniors of our community will still have a place to meet, and the city will not be confronted with 100 percent of the costs for the upkeep of the building.\u201d"

      "(CNN) \u2014 A child throwing a ball. On the face of it, a simple act, but for four-year old Hannah Mohn this is a milestone.",
      "Hannah was born with the neuromuscular disease arthrogryposis, which makes her joints curve and muscles extremely weak. She can\u2019t lift her arms very high without help.",
      "\u201cWe knew about five months into the pregnancy that something was not right,\u201d says Hannah\u2019s mother, Jennifer Mohn.",
      "\u201cWe were told that they did not believe that she would survive birth and that we should really think about what we wanted done and make arrangements for the day that she were to be born.\u201d",
      "Hannah survived, but with severe challenges and a long road ahead.",
      "Jennifer explains: \u201cWhen we saw my pediatrician \u2026 for one of her first visits, she said even if her legs don\u2019t work well enough for her to walk, the biggest thing that we need to work on is making sure that her hands and arms are working to the fullest extent, because if she has use of her hands and arms, she will be able to care for herself. If she doesn\u2019t have the ability to use her legs, she can at least use a wheelchair. And that stuck with me.\u201d",
      "Hannah\u2019s chance at a normal life came aged 18 months, when she visited the Dupont Children\u2019s Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware \u2014 a leading hospital in the United States. She began using a device the hospital designed, called the \u201cWREX\u201d \u2014 robotic arms made from 3-D printing.",
      "\u201cWREX stands for Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton,\u201d explains Whitney Sample, a research design engineer at the hospital. \u201cMost of the kids that we deal with have neuromuscular issues that affect their ability to raise their arms. So they have a lot of difficulty getting their hand to their mouth, doing typical activities of daily living \u2014 combing their hair, scratching their nose \u2026 so it allows their arm to pretty much float.\u201d",
      "The WREX uses special elastic bands to give a child\u2019s arm a weightless feeling. \u201cThe mechanism is similar to how a luxo lamp works to make it \u2018effortless\u2019 to move and position the head of the lamp,\u201d says Sample.",
      "It\u2019s a life-changing device, and one that\u2019s benefitted hugely from 3-D printing. Producing components on site by printing them layer by layer greatly reduces the time it takes to create a WREX.",
      "\u201cWe can print a full set of plastic parts for one pair of WREXs for one patient overnight, and by the end of the next work day we can clean the parts and have the WREX fully assembled,\u201d says Sample, adding that metal components must also be made by traditional methods prior to assembly.",
      "Even after 25 years designing devices for those with disabilities, Sample still gets emotional when children he has helped thank him for the difference he\u2019s making.",
      "When one child was given a school assignment to write a story about their personal hero, they chose to write about Sample.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have that recognition when the families come back and say \u2018Hey, this has been wonderful for us,'\u201d he says.",
      "Arthrogryposis is a condition that affects one in 3,000 children born in the United States, according to the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine. The Dupont Children\u2019s Hospital says it sees a little more than 30 new cases each year.",
      "View Photo Gallery",
      "\u201cWe treat all spectrums of orthopedic disease,\u201d says Dr. William Mackenzie, chair of the hospital\u2019s orthopedics department.",
      "\u201c3-D printing is allowing us to build devices very precisely \u2014 to build a device that can be attached and be closely adapted to that individual person\u2019s physique and improve function.",
      "\u201cThe next step, we think, is when we could put small motors in these joints that the child would control with either a twitch of the muscle or perhaps a laser. We don\u2019t know quite how might it be controlled, but we see that that is the future of the WREX.\u201d",
      "The device has helped improve Hannah\u2019s movements, even when she is not using it.",
      "\u201cThe biggest change that we\u2019ve seen is the ability for her to reach up higher and the ability to sustain that,\u201d says Jennifer. \u201cHer elbows are typically stuck at her sides and that\u2019s where she\u2019s been limited to raising her arms and reaching for things.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s gaining muscle strength in her arms that she hasn\u2019t had. It definitely teaches her about things with different textures and colors, shapes and where things go and how things work.\u201d",
      "Teaching her, and opening up a future that knows no limits.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that she grows up to be as independent as she can,\u201d says Jennifer. \u201cI\u2019d love to see her go to college. As sassy as she is and as much as she likes to be in charge, she might run for president someday \u2014 who knows?",
      "\u201cUp to this point there hasn\u2019t been much that she has let stop her. Whatever it is, she\u2019s going to achieve it.\u201d",

      "The La Plata County Sheriffs Office is advising the public that a man convicted of attempting to sexually assault a child has been released from prison to live in Durango.",
      "William Vollert, 22, was convicted of the charge in December 2008 in La Plata County, according to the La Plata County Sheriffs Office.",
      "A psychological evaluation determined him to be a sexually violent predator, which means authorities must notify residents of his whereabouts upon release.",
      "Vollert was released Jan. 17, said Patrick Beyer, with the Sheriffs Office.",
      "According to an online database, Vollert is living at 10 Rio Vista Circle, near East Fourth Avenue and 29th Street.",
      "If he ever moves, he must inform authorities of his new address. He must register as a sex offender every three months.",
      "He last registered on March 11, 2011. He violated his parole and was arrested June 11, 2011, and sent back to prison to finish the remainder of his sentence.",
      "La Plata County has three registered sexually violent predators and 146 registered sex offenders. There are 15,702 registered sex offenders in Colorado.",
      "Retaliation against sexual-assault offenders is illegal, Beyer said in the release. Harassing a sexual-assault offender can force the offender underground, make him stop registering as a sex offender and make it harder for authorities to track the persons progress, he said.",
      "It is better if authorities can monitor the offenders and help ensure they comply with the registration laws and/or treatment, Beyer wrote in the release.",
      "Anyone seeking additional information can call Beyer at 382-7069.",

      "Well, I guess the Initramfs article (in the unofficial wiki) plus a HOWTO or two in the forums just do somthing with that in mind. I don't know if it's crystal clear for an initramfs noob. I'd just add that the basic is pretty simple build a static busybox with many \"applets\" (basic commad like dd, cp, mv, et. all) as one will need if not the whole stack so you don't bother to ask yourself what is needed for what? And then construct the root `/' of the initramfs as one would expect in basic system with bin:sbin:lib:usr:dev:sys:proc with devices nodes in dev if the init script does not take care of creating them, plus extra binaries/libraries that one may need with his/her init script of choice.",

That's where the building script comes into play and leave the user in the middle of nowhere if he/she doesn't has basic idea of how to build an initramfs. But there's nothing that complicated with what is posted on the wiki or forum, the int script is a bit long (several hundreds of lines of a POSIX sh script), that's all. Did you even try to read Arch initramfs' building script? That one is complicated because it is intended to adress everything without requiring the user anything but a few configurations options.",

My work in North American and South African arid habitats reveals that desert green algae have multiple evolutionary origins.

      "Late last week we announced we were hiring two people for the ultimate job: covering the Tour de France for CyclingTips as part of a Bikestyle Tours group. We\u2019ve had some great applications so far and before entries close (at 11.59pm on Friday May 30 AEST) we wanted to give you a bit of a taste and hopefully inspire you to submit your own entry.",
      "If you haven\u2019t read the initial announcement post, with details about the prize, you can do so here.",
      "When we were putting together this job opportunity we considered making the application process quite strict and tightly defined. But we quickly decided it was best to leave things open.",
      "We set some boundaries \u2014 we don\u2019t want to read thousands of words or watch an hour of video per entry! \u2014 but we wanted to let people\u2019s creativity come through. We wanted you to tell us how you would cover the Tour de France for us and to use your application to show us what you\u2019re capable of.",
      "It\u2019s been great to see the creative responses we\u2019ve had so far and we thought we\u2019d share some with you now.",
      "Some people opted for a text-based application, showing us their skill with the written word:",
      "\u201cWhen asked after the stage the break will say they were happy to make a try of it, and to get their sponsors on TV. It\u2019s not true though \u2014 every one of them dreams of waking in the morning and donning the maillot jaune, no matter how long they\u2019ve been toiling, collecting bottles for luckier, more talented riders. The problem is, the numbers are against them. They don\u2019t have the watts in their legs, the volume in their lungs. They are elite riders, but they are not true contenders \u2013 and they know it. Surely they know it?",
      "A young man at the front dreams of yellow and his left hand flicks once and one foot becomes five and then ten and then twenty. Suddenly he is alone \u2014 one man and the quiet tick of his chain, the sound of rushing blood and heavy breathing. History is being written.",
      "Others made more descriptive pleas:",
      "\u201cMy team will work and play to make sure the life of the Tour is bleeding out of our pores. Yes, our bodies will emanate the bicycle race, but it will radiate France and all it has to offer. The romance of France kissing our faces, the sounds of exhilaration, the climax of running next to the polka dot jersey on the Col du Tourmalet hollering words of encouragement as the locals stare in wonder. Send us. The world is waiting and we are ready.",
      "Some folks decidedly to show us what their coverage of Le Tour would like \u2026 by mocking up the CT website with their own content:",
      "Including with subtle changes to the site\u2019s logo:",
      "One duo went to the trouble of setting up their own blog and sending us tweets about each update in an attempt to gain our attention. They also tried to impress us with their Strava art skills (as featured earlier this week in the Rocacorba Daily):",
      "Some people told us what they had planned, explaining that Le Tour is so much more than a bike race:",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to fans. We\u2019ll try and talk to pros, and if we can\u2019t do that we\u2019ll take photos of pros from the side of the road. We\u2019ll take photos of vistas, because, after all, it\u2019s the Alps. We\u2019ll take photos of ourselves, and people that we meet, because we know that if you\u2019re following the Tour you\u2019re going to see the peloton for a few seconds and then you\u2019re going to see a whole lot of something else for a few hours.",
      "And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to try and convey: just how big a bike race this is, and how small a glimpse of it a fan can get. But these glimpses, and the hours in between, are what we want to show.",
      "Others got a bit more whimsical, trying to charm us with poetry:",
      "We saw people take to Instragram:",
      "And others put together entertaining video applications, like this guy:",
      "And this team:",
      "There were infographics:",
      "And there were examples of photography from previous Tours people had covered:",
      "We\u2019ve received a lot of entries and we expect it\u2019s going to be a pretty difficult job selecting a winner. But we\u2019re looking forward to it. And as mentioned, entries are still open until 11.59pm (AEST) tomorrow night, so if you were thinking of applying, please do! You can find everything you need to know here.",
      "Some quick tips if you are submitting an application:",
      "\u2013 You need to get our attention quickly. We have lots of entries to go through, not to mention that all of us here at CyclingTips have a limited attention span. If you send us a whole website to look at, or a 10-minute video, chances are we won\u2019t see all of it.",
      "\u2013 Make sure you sign up to our weekly newsletter and that you\u2019ve read the terms and conditions.",
      "\u2013 Be creative. We want to see you thinking outside the square. So many media outlets cover the Tour de France in so much detail that it\u2019s often hard to find something different to say. We want your coverage to be different. Show us how you\u2019ll do that.",
      "Once entries are closed we\u2019ll go through all the applications we\u2019ve received and narrow it down to a shortlist. Then we\u2019ll call up everyone on the shortlist for an informal interview. And finally, late next week hopefully, we\u2019ll announce our winners.",
      "Good luck!"

      "1 And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be afaithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not bmightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?",
      "2 Therefore let us go up; let us be astrong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the bRed Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh",
      "3 Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an aangel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye bdoubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to cdeliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.",
      "4 Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.",
      "5 And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves without the walls. And after they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.",
      "6 And I was aled by the Spirit, not bknowing beforehand the things which I should do.",
      "7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was adrunken with wine.",
      "8 And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.",
      "9 And I beheld his asword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.",
      "10 And it came to pass that I was aconstrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.",
      "11 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the aLord hath bdelivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had ctaken away our property.",
      "12 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;",
      "13 Behold the Lord aslayeth the bwicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is cbetter that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in dunbelief.",
      "14 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: aInasmuch as thy seed shall keep my bcommandments, they shall cprosper in the dland of promise.",
      "15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the alaw of Moses, save they should have the law.",
      "16 And I also knew that the alaw was engraven upon the plates of brass.",
      "17 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands for this cause\u00e2that I might obtain the records according to his commandments.",
      "18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own asword.",
      "19 And after I had smitten off his",
      "20 And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the aservant of Laban who had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he should go with me into the treasury.",
      "21 And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the garments and also the sword girded about my loins.",
      "22 And he spake unto me concerning the aelders of the Jews, he knowing that his master, Laban, had been out by night among them.",
      "23 And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban.",
      "24 And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings, which were upon the aplates of brass, to my elder brethren, who were without the walls.",
      "25 And I also bade him that he should follow me.",
      "26 And he, supposing that I spake of the abrethren of the bchurch, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me.",
      "27 And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I went forth unto my brethren, who were without the walls.",
      "28 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my presence; for they supposed it was Laban, and that he had slain me and had sought to take away their lives also.",
      "29 And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.",
      "30 And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my brethren he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before me and return to the city of Jerusalem.",
      "31 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having received much astrength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the servant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.",
      "32 And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so that if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his life.",
      "33 And I spake unto him, even with an aoath, that he need not fear; that he should be a bfree man like unto us if he would go down in the wilderness with us.",
      "34 And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath acommanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with us.",
      "35 And it came to pass that aZoram did take courage at the words which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he promised that he would go down into the wilderness unto our father. Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us from that time forth.",
      "36 Now we were desirous that he should tarry with us for this cause, that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into the wilderness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.",
      "37 And it came to pass that when aoath unto us, our bfears did cease concerning him.",
      "38 And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the servant of Laban, and departed into the wilderness, and journeyed unto the atent of our father."

      "Well here tis - the final results.",
      "165 games were mentioned abd nearly 100 boomers participated.",
      "As usual, an alphabetical and numerical list will follow. I have taken some liberties with the names where series or sequels are involved, and have tried to use full and alternate titles where possible.",
      "Any errors are of course my own.",
      "The winner might surprise. As I said at the start I thought there would be a \"new\" first place. No prizes for guessing which game I thought it would be. But there wasn't much in it.",
      "Great to see two releases from last year so prominent, yet at the same time those oldies but goodies keep hanging in there.",
      "And as I say every year, every game on this list is a good one, as at least one boomer thought it was worth recommending out of all the games out there.",
      "So without further ado, here are the results",
      "Quantity has a quality all of its own",

      "The first way to change streams is to create a new video element via Javascript, wait for it to load, then replace the current video with the new one. Unfortunately, HTML5 gives no way to prevent the original video, even when stopped, from using all available bandwidth to keep buffering as fast as it can. This starves the replacement video of network access, causing a lengthy delay when loading. It looks very nice and seamless when it finally works, but can easily result is switching video streams taking 15-30 seconds or more.",
      "The second option is to switch the pre-existing video element to a new stream. This is much faster as the original stream stops sinking bandwidth immediately, but upon loading it always starts from the beginning and in current browsers also displays the first frame, even if playback isn't started. After the load completes, then it's possible to seek forward to where the original stream started. It doesn't look as good, but it's much faster in practice.",
