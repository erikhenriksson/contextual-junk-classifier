{"line": "This Article seeks to examine how policy can be used strategically to foster the development of a plug-in electric vehicle (\"PEV\") industry cluster in Michigan. The tendency for certain industries to localize in particular regions has captured the interest of much economic research and policy discussion in recent years. The trend toward the clustering of new industries has stayed strong despite the acceleration of globalization. Attention to clusters has proven to be an enduring theme in economic development circles for nearly thirty years. Clusters generate synergies that make industrial activity greater than the sum of contributions by individual players. In this Article, we review a broad array of literature on the development of economic clusters in general, assess the key elements of the PEV value chain, and summarize interviews with several major players along the electric vehicle value chain. Our goal is to look beyond simply \"buying\" jobs with tax subsidies, and to identify ways in which targeted policy support can spark a self-perpetuating, high-technology PEV economic cluster centered in the State of Michigan. The remainder of this Article is organized as follows. First, in Part I, we review the literature on industrial clusters in order to identify the broad features of clustering behavior. In Part II, we explore the factors that lead industries to cluster in the first place, apply this analysis to the case of the automobile industry in the twentieth century, and assesses the likelihood of development of PEVs within one or more industrial clusters. Part III turns to the key characteristics of successful clusters. Part IV explores the factors Michigan will need to successfully build a PEV cluster and examines the range of policy options that have been used to support cluster development in various locations around the world. Part V pulls the foregoing analysis together by presenting a set of policy recommendations that may support the creation of a successful PEV cluster in Michigan.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

You'll want to make sure that the company's going to be there to pay the claim when you have one, so it's important to ask your agent about the financial stability of the carriers that they're placing you with. You also want to make sure that it's a service-friendly company. You can ask around with friends and neighbors if they've had experience with that insurer--whether their claim was paid on time; did they respond to any inquiries you have about your coverage in a timely fashion? Etc. All that goes into part of the insurance package, as well as price. It's great to have the cheapest coverage that you can get.

Cannon Design's integrated project team used a single model that combined information from Revit Architecture, Revit Structure and Revit MEP models to coordinate not only the physical aspects of the building design, but also the quantity takeoffs, cost estimates, specifications, project schedule and construction drawings to help ensure more accurate alignment of scope and budget. The BIM process and Revit model helped minimize costly and time-consuming redesigns.

Can you imagine a time when women and people of colour decided, en masse and without exception, ‘ah, heck, let’s just accept our destinies and keep our heads down’? No, me either.

Specifically, the Complainant alleged that the amendments to the grievance procedure would deprive students of access to a prompt and equitable resolution of complaints, as required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), by requiring grievants to present information showing “sufficient independent corroboration” of their claims prior to the College initiating an investigation. The Complainant further alleged that other types of peer-to-peer discrimination complaints, such as racial or sexual harassment, are handled under another standard which does not require that the grievant provide a list of supporting information to get a full investigation.

In some cases, having a drink with colleagues or clients is part of the essential process to closing a sale. In other times, employees or stockholders will expect the supervisors to celebrate special achievements or company milestones with a shared drink. Unfortunately, these myriads of opportunities to drink also put executives at risk of developing alcohol problems, such as alcoholism or alcohol abuse. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, men should drink no more than two servings of alcohol a day and women should limit consumption to one drink or fewer each day. Drinking more than the suggested intake on a regular basis or drinking large amounts in one sitting can be signs of a problem. In more serious cases, the executive may exhibit a harmful, dangerous, irrational, or unhealthy behavior that stems from drinking. An executive with an alcohol problem may start to hide his or her drinking from others, become violent or irritable while drinking or when denied alcohol, drink in inappropriate circumstances, or become obsessed with getting another drink.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

It was a joyous occasion. How well he has filled the position of husband and father. His home has been a model home. He removed from New York to Middleburgh in 1839. On the first of January 1840, I having just been admitted as a co-partner, we commenced the practice of law. How changed since that time! as I stand here to-night (sic) and bring up to mind those days, no wonder, your Honor, and I know I will be pardoned, if my lip quivers and my eyes are filled with tears. I stand here almost alone, as my hand rests on the broad shoulder of my brother, Brewster, who came to the practice in July, 1840. Of all those who were engaged in the practice of the law prior to that time, all, all are gone save William H. Davis, Hamilton and Goodyear, Houck and Mann, Holladay and Gebhard, at Schoharie, Spafford and McClellan, at Middleburgh, Thomas and Demosthenes Lawyer, Thomas Smith and Jedediah Miller, of Cobleskill, William Beekman, of Sharon, and John C. Wright, of Esperance. They were men who could have been an honor to any county of the State. The then four Judges of the old Common Pleas have entered into rest.

{"line": "1. The common vole, Microtus arvalis, like other vole species, in captivity has a short-term activity rhythm in daytime, with a period of circa two hours. Trapping records show that this rhythm exists also in field conditions, with the population in synchrony to some degree; a correlation of trapping frequency with vole predation by kestrels indicates that it reflects the true natural behaviour. 2. The evidence in Microtus agrestis that the short-term activity rhythm is essentially a feeding rhythm is supported for the common vole by separate recording of wheel running, feeding and nestbox occupation. 3. The short-term rhythm is phase-locked to dawn. There is fair intraindividual constancy from day to day in the timing of meals, but interindividual variation causes a gradual breakdown of population synchrony in the course of the day, both in the field and in captive isolation. 4. The frequency of the rhythm may be evolutionarily adjusted to metabolic demands of the species, as suggested by its dependence on body weight, but remains relatively invariant in the face of experimental (temperature) manipulation of metabolic expenditure. In the absence of food during the day, feeding attempts recur with the same timing as meals did before: periodic changes in satiety, related to food intake and digestion are insufficient to account for such changes in feeding motivation. 5. The risk of being killed by a kestrel is lower for voles active in phase with the population majority than for voles out of phase with the population: there is safety in numbers. Numbers vary dramatically in vole populations, however, and the generality of predatory selection for prey synchrony remains to be tested. 6. Foraging behaviour of the common vole is regulated by a circadian timing system even though feeding is spread evenly over night and day. The adaptive advantage of circadian entrustment with the timing of feeding motivation above meal timing by digestive processes is sought in the individual repetition of daily patterns as the optimal strategic answer to temporal day-to-day correlations in the environment.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

The ethics of shooting defenseless teenagers at summer camp can be questioned, to say the least, but it sure was a brilliant way to strike at the core of the Norwegian political elite. These are the next generation of political leaders, and what better way to terrorize the parents – the current top holders of political office – than going after their kids? As Glenn Beck has observed, the AUF youth at Utøya are reminiscent of Hitler-Jugend. Utøya is where leftist kids come to be indoctrinated every summer, steeping themselves in liberal propaganda and listening to inspirational speeches by current and former social democratic leaders such as Gro Harlem Brundtland. In retrospect, it was extremely thoughtless by the ruling class not to post a single armed guard at this event. Politics is serious business after all, and such a hotbed of recruitment concentrated on an island with no easy escape is an obvious target for political enemies, if you think about it.

More than a quaint throwback to the heady acme of Skinnerian psychology, Tavistock describes itself as an organization of “dynamic psychiatry” intended to practice what it calls “societry,” otherwise known as mass perceptual manipulation and management, on the planet as a whole. According to the late maverick researcher Jim Keith, Tavistock was born from “the collaboration of the international moneyed elite, military intelligence, and the materialist psychiatric community.” Keith notes that Kurt Lewin, co-founder of the American Office of Strategic Services (precursor to CIA) “is credited with much of the Original Tavistock research into mass brainwashing, applying the results” of government-sponsored mind-control experiments involving the “repeated traumatizing and torture of individuals to society at large.” Writing in the mid-‘90s, Keith characterized the theory behind Tavistock. “[I]f terror can be induced on a widespread basis then society…reverts to a tabula rasa…situation where control can easily be instituted from an exterior point… By the creation of controlled chaos the populace can be brought to the point where it willingly submits to increasing increments of control… Lewin maintained society must be driven into a state equivalent to an ‘early childhood situation’ which he termed ‘fluidity.’” Tavistock literature reiterates its “global vision,” admits its “military” orientation and makes it clear, according to Keith, “that the Institute intends to practice its long-term ‘societry’ on the world regardless of the wishes of the individuals who inhabit it.”", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Anachronisms – such as the use of “learning curve”, “fan club” and “defining moment” in the UK TV series Downton Abbey – provide fun for gaffe spotters. Getting the language of the period right is perhaps even more important for creating atmosphere than costume and setting – a misused phrase can stand out like a pylon in an ageless rural scene.

If there is nothing else out of the ordinary you should check the gas cap for tightness the next time you stop your car. If the cap is loose it may take a few driving trips before the computer turns the light off. If the cap is not loose, or it was and the light does not turn off within a day or so, contact us for further diagnosis. Again, most of the time there is nothing unsafe about driving with the light on but the car may not perform normally and fuel economy may suffer.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "Wednesday's Walk started because I often do my best thinking as I walk. And so I've made a commitment to share some of the things I think about as a Kaizen-Muse Creativity Coach each Wednesday. This week I have been thinking about the importance of making a commitment - to yourself and your dreams. I am not one to write my posts way ahead of time. I like to get up on Wednesday morning and write my post for the day. That's just me. This morning when I got up I knew I had things to do for my husband, needed to get ready to visit with my grandchildren, as well as do some other things that needed to get done. My old self (which tried to creep into my thoughts) thought I'll just write the post later after I get everything else done. The new self said, \"Wait a minute! You made a commitment to yourself to share a coaching tip each week. Your commitment to others is very important but so is the commitment you made to yourself.\" So I took a second to rearrange my thoughts, decided what I should do first (write this post), and then got to work on the other things I want or needed to do. One of the things I write about often is how we can move ahead and make progress on our dreams if we take small steps. This is very true. But there has to be a commitment to those small steps. If you want to make a change, start a business, create a new hobby, it can all be done by taking one small step a time. But small steps will only become big changes if we are commited to taking those steps. I love coaching women who are beginning to make changes in their lives and need a little extra support. I'm commited to helping them find the time to make those changes. I am commited to helping them overcome the obstacles that may stand in their way such as perfectionism or overwhelm. So my coaching tip for today is - taking small steps towards making your dream or dreams come true works. It truly works! But you have to be commited to taking those steps in order to see where they lead you. It is that commitment that makes what was once a beautiful idea become a beautiful reality. What commitment and small step would you like to make and take today?", "label": "clean", "split": false}

And once we start that it'll happen, but it's not anything like that. You're always having to think way past that. Talk about this, about thinking past the finish line. This is a very important takeaway for this, is that in, in anything that you're doing, sometimes your mind is only set on achieving that goal that you had set and it could be lofty or important or whatever it is, but it's most often getting to that is usually not the problem it's actually following through and finishing whatever, you know, is required after that. And so thinking past the finish line is a critical one. And in my case in that clinical trial, we ended up getting to the end result, but it wasn't pretty in terms of getting there. We almost ran out money as a company. It took too long. The number of patients that we had to enroll in the study had to get larger. And then we had to go to more sites around the world.

{"line": "A natural step in this analyses could be the construction of gene co-expression networks using the union of the DE genes between two brain regions. In this case, some genes would be present in the network that were not considered differentially expressed in a certain region. Genes not considered significantly DE in any region could be due to 2 reasons - (a) noisy expression data and therefore not informative or (b) no change in expression in that region. We noticed that statistically significant DE genes with low gene expression tended to have lower network connectivity in that regional network. Moreover, if a gene has low expression in both regions or high expression in both regions, it does not have a large connectivity difference between the two regional networks. Since we are only analysing genes that have statistically significant differential expression, we can interpret downstream results with more confidence and not expect the results being due to chance. In our analyses on genes with a large difference in their network connectivity, we attribute this to their down regulation in a certain stage of AD because we know that certain regions get affected later on in the course of AD progression and therefore show early molecular changes occurring in AD. However, if genes that are not DE in a region are included in the network, we would not be able to ascertain whether the connectivity difference was due to statistically insignificant changes in expression (either due to technical regions or biological) or because they were truly up or down regulated in that stage of AD.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

So let’s take that manifesto of the Russian revolution, The Battleship Potemkin, which in 1925 narrated the first spark of the Bolshevik revolution which had broken out twenty years previously in Odessa. The most famous scene in the history of cinema, the photogram which even the history books which document the seizure of power of the Russian revolutionaries say is totally invented: there was no massacre on the famous steps of Odessa. This is not the only case where the images of Eisenstein altered history, rightly so, one may understand. When he arrived at the Winter Palace to shoot the scene of the assault for October, the film made in 1928 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the revolution, the Soviet maestro realised that the steps which the Bolsheviks had gone up were too small for the action that he had in mind. He thus filmed the scene on the massive stairway used during the Tsarist epoch for state processions. And that became to all effects and purposes the pathway of the revolution of October. An enormous fiction as regards historical reality, with five thousand veterans of the civil war who made the few hundred sailors and red guards who in historical terms had taken part in the seizure of the palace into an army. The loaded rifles of the extras wounded the passersby and destroyed the Sèvres vases which had survived the revolution. In his memoirs Eisenstein recalled the words of the old porter who swept up the pieces: “your people were much more careful the first time that they took the palace.”", "label": "clean", "split": false}

The global population reached 3 billion in 1960 (33years); 4 billion in 1974 (14year); and 5 billion in 1987 (13year). It then took a mere 12 years for the global population to reach the current level of approximately 6 billion people in 1999.” And without doubt, the numbers will continue rising in the future, so what directly induces from the unchecked population growth is that the resources on the earth will not meet the need of everyone. Meantime, the environmental impacts of population growth are ubiquitous and universal. For instance, population growth has a direct impact on agricultural resources.

{"line": "Based on the experimental observations and results from single-shear pull-off tests, bond-slip models were developed for CFRP-to-steel interfaces with a linear adhesive and those with a non-linear adhesive respectively. The bond-slip models include an explicit formula which predicts the interfacial fracture energy from the properties of the adhesive. Analytical solutions were also developed for predicting the full-range bond behaviour and the bond strength of CFRP-to-steel bonded joints, with the definition of the effective bond length addressed as an important issue. By making use of the bond-slip model for linear adhesives developed in the present work, finite element modelling was conducted to simulate debonding failures in steel beams flexurally-strengthened with CFRP. In the FE model, the bond-slip model was employed with a mixed-mode cohesive law which considers the effect of interaction between mode I loading and mode II loading on damage propagation within the adhesive. Predictions from the FE model are shown to compare well with existing test results. The proposed FE model represents a significant advancement in the modelling of debonding failures in CFRP-strengthened steel structures. The last part of the thesis extends the capability of FE analysis to the prediction of debonding failures in the more complex problem of rectangular steel tubes with CFRP plates bonded on the webs subjected to an end bearing load. A series of tests is first presented, in which the effects of adhesive types and web slenderness on the effectiveness of CFRP strengthening were examined. The failure of such members is normally controlled by the debonding of the CFRP plates, so the properties of the adhesive used are shown to be very important. The test results show that an adhesive with a larger strain energy (e.g. a softer nonlinear adhesive) leads to a larger load-carrying capacity for a strengthened rectangular hollow section (RHS) steel tubes. A FE model is next presented, in which the effect of interaction between mode I loading and mode II loading on damage propagation within the adhesive is duly considered. This FE model is shown to closely predict the experimental behaviour of these CFRP-strengthened tubes.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

If you believe that learners can’t develop as they do not have ‘talent’ it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: those who believe that they are not ‘good at’ something will not put much effort into their learning because what is the use if you can’t improve? And as a result, they indeed do not progress much. Try to foster a growth-mindset in the classroom; using the word ‘yet’ can highlight to our learners that learning requires time and effort.

Interpretive Summary: Vegetation indices calculated from remote sensing imagery are commonly used to estimate crop plant growth and yield, but most of these indices use only two spectral bands in the image. This study evaluated linear spectral unmixing techniques, which can use all the bands in the image, for estimating yield variability from airborne multispectral imagery. Linear spectral unmixing models were applied to five time-sequential airborne images collected from a grain sorghum field to generate crop plant and soil abundance images. Plant and soil abundance data were significantly related to grain yield with equivalent or better correlations compared with the normalized difference vegetation index. These results indicate that linear spectral unmixing techniques can be used alone or in conjunction with traditional vegetation indices for quantifying crop canopy cover and mapping crop yield.", "label": "Bibliographical and Citation References", "split": false}

That the immigrant brothers are nearly identical (right down to their freakishly large ear lobes) is, of course, an essential plot point that's been carried through in various countries' version of the folk tale, though, here, the townspeople's inability to see that there is more than one brother also stands in racist xenophobia. (To be fair, as presented in the book, about the only thing to distinguish the brothers is their powers – and the fact that the brother with super-sensitive eyesight wears sunglasses.) From X-Men on, super-hero tales have frequently been used to focus on the persecuted Other, of course, though in this case the metaphor has historical antecedent in the era's exploitation of Chinese immigrant laborers. At one level, you get the sense that – even if they weren't identical – most of the white townsfolk wouldn't be able to differentiate the Chinese brothers, anyway.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

This distinguished lineage immersed Artur in the tradition of the ‘Golden Age’ of pianism and gave him a broad education in both the German and French piano schools and repertoire. After initial studies in Lisbon, Artur moved to Lawrence, Kansas in the USA and continued working with Sequeira Costa who is Distinguished Professor of Piano at the University of Kansas.

Data is still central to school improvement, but what Inquiry adds to this overall process is a real focus on systems of professional learning over time that is rooted in curiousity about individual student needs. Inquiry is a systemic and informed approach to school improvement that involves all stakeholders in a school community – school administration, staff, students, and parents/guardians – to be involved in this transformative process.

{"line": "The suitability of an AOP for applications in research or regulatory decision making is solely based on the biological accuracy of the mechanism presented, biological plausibility and measurability of KEs and the weight of evidence presented in support of KERs. AOP 173 for lung fibrosis has undergone internal and external review by the OECD EAGMST AOP committee and the external subject matter experts, respectively and is currently under revision. In Fig. 3, the well accepted mechanism of lung fibrosis (AOP 173) is presented with a number of non-animal assays that can potentially be used to assess different KEs. Table 2 lists the KEs in AOP 173 (identified by their ID on AOPwiki) and specific cell types, endpoints and assays used for measuring the specified KEs in nanotoxicology literature. This information can be used to build a non-animal testing strategy for predicting nanomaterial-induced lung fibrosis. To be effective, the strategy must include a combination of assays and endpoints targeting more than one KE in AOP 173. While a number of assays have been identified, what is not clear for now is which assays or endpoints should be prioritized and the rationale for prioritization of one assay or endpoint over the other is lacking. For example, in the case of inflammation, the list of specific actors and cell types used to measure higher order KEs of inflammation depends on individual researcher’s expertise, resources and experiences. The heterogeneity in assay types, objects assessed or cell type used poses significant challenges in interpreting the data derived from these assays. Moreover, questions such as 1) do all biomarkers bear equal sensitivity in predicting in vivo inflammation, 2) how many pro-inflammatory mediators should be assessed at a minimum and 3) how is altered expression defined and if the definition can be applied across different biomarkers of inflammation consistently, have to be addressed. A criterion for selection of biomarkers from the vast number of pleotropic and redundant pro-inflammatory mediators should be carefully established and guidance regarding the minimum set of cell-type-specific object changes that represent occurrence of a given KE needs to be defined. In order for such prioritization or for developing animal alternative testing strategies for lung fibrosis, a common dataset generated using the different assays and endpoints listed in Fig. 3 or Table 2, for different nanomaterials and their variants is required. The resulting outcome of such an analysis will include thousands of data points from a heterogenous group of assays and endpoints describing dose-responses for several nanomaterials and their property variants. The integrated analysis of all data and interpretation of such data will require sophisticated and dynamic computational modelling approaches. Some nanoinformatics infrastructure for such an undertaking already exists. Models developed as part of ToxCast and Tox21 initiatives for chemicals can be used, which will enable integration of data from multiple assays and aid in the interpretation of data describing the biological relevance and identification of point-of-no return or tipping points associated with dose-dependent transitions from adaptive cellular responses to adverse outcomes . It is important to note that in all of the AOPs involving early inflammatory and immune events, initiation and progression of early inflammatory KEs towards the AO greatly depends on the relative balance of damage & repair, stressor characteristics, time, and exposure conditions, all of which may limit the predictive potential of an in vitro strategy. Thus, a well-thought combination of KEs and advanced in vitro models for measuring them may be required to attain effective predictions of outcomes. Certain properties of nanomaterials such as shape, aspect ratio, chemical composition can serve as alerts or triggers for an MIE; however, property alerts for all nanomaterials have not been identified, necessitating testing of most suspected nanomaterials using multiple assays and endpoints. Until a validated strategy is available, a simple decision tree as shown in Fig. 4 can be used in a tiered testing strategy involving Tier-1 measurement of higher degree inflammatory KEs and Tier-2 testing of KEs downstream of inflammation representing histological manifestation of the disease. Since standardized protocols and guidance on testing are not available, each KE may have to be assessed using more than one assay and multiple endpoints. As the data generated from using these assays increases, the strategy can be improved by selecting most predictive parameters or by including additional parameters to define predictive efficiency. In addition, as more data becomes available, criteria for evaluating the in vitro methods addressing aspects such as, what KE is assessed or predicted by the assay, how close is the measured endpoint to the response observed in vivo, how many nanomaterials have been tested using the method, does the method allow dose-response analysis and is there a standard operating protocol available, can be developed to select the assays and endpoints that demonstrate the best predictive potential. In a recent study by Rahman et al., (2020), a testing strategy involving a combination of a transcriptomic signature consisting of 17 genes (referred to as PFS17) predictive of lung fibrosis targeting different KEs in the AOP 173 and an ex vivo precision cut lung slice method was proposed as a promising alternative to assess lung inflammation and lung fibrosis induced by nanomaterials . Although these strategies and specific methodologies are well described for chemicals , they are not readily applicable for nanomaterials due to lack of data. The novel approaches described here are still in their infancy in the context of nanomaterials and will require further validation before their routine integration into nanomaterial research and regulation.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

The extent of this transformation means that it is no longer accurate to say that humans have created a variety of anthromes that are nested within the regional biomes; rather, with only a few percent of pristine landscape left, it is more appropriate to say that there are now patches of more or less undisturbed biome left within anthrome-dominated terrestrial biology.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

This utility attempts to restore it to the quad core state. To test this feature, I placed a Phenom II X2 555 \"Black Edition\" processor into the system and flipped the switch. To my amaze the system automatically unlocked the other two cores with no other input from me.

That “nascent society,” as Rousseau calls it, was good while it lasted; it was indeed the “golden age” of human history. Only it did not endure. With the tender passion of love there was also born the destructive passion of jealousy. Neighbours started to compare their abilities and achievements with one another, and that “marked the first step towards inequality and at the same time towards vice.” People started to demand consideration and respect.

Because of this, more and stronger connections – such as visual and auditory – are being formed, which is called ‘deeper learning’. Possibly the most impactful discovery for us educators so far is the importance of imagery for learning (Zull, 2002). Human beings are biologically programmed to draw more information from pictures than text, as nature has built the ability to see and interpret the visual world into our brain. Paivio’s dual-coding theory (cited in Brown, Roediger III & McDaniel, 2014) confirms the impact images have on storing and recalling information. Showing a picture and telling a story meant learners remembered 65% of the story after three days, as opposed to just 10% recall after three days when the story was presented without suitable images. So, selecting interesting images and linking new vocabulary to these can enhance learners retention of the new information.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Plato talked about how women differed from men in physical attributes, but had the same intellectual abilities as the best of men, and should therefore be assigned the same vital functions in society. Thomas More’s Utopia, though not as progressive, had women involved in government, labor and battle. Voltaire was attracted to Émilie du Châtelet because of her intellectual genius (most probably far greater than his). Despite all this, however, women received the vote in most countries only when all counter arguments had been exhausted, and even then with great reluctance.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

So one way you do it is pretend that it doesn't bother you in the slightest and she was very good at that.

Creatine Monohydrate (CML) As much as any substance in sports, Creatine Monohydrate has become known for being \"the poster boy\" of the \"Bulking\" category, best bulking cutting cycle. The primary benefit of creatine supplementation is that it provides the body enough fuel for the training the body is doing, best bulking injectable steroid stack. Creatine is a molecule that consists of carbon, hydrogen, magnesium and oxygen. During training, the body uses it in an ATP form. Creatine is what you need to replenish the ATP stores after you're done training for the day, best steroids for bulking. Creatine is a potent source of energy for the body, best bulking cutting cycle. It works as a \"bulk booster\" as well. Creatine Monohydrate is very cheap, which makes it incredibly affordable. For some guys, it can be an effective bulking substance because the price is so low, yet it is so effective. One way to ensure that you get enough Creatine Monohydrate is to take several forms during the week; this will ensure that the body gets the right amount of Creatine Monohydrate for the situation at hand. I don't recommend supplementing Creatine Monohydrate with anything else besides a good water source, best anabolic steroids for sale. This goes against the \"one, ONE, ONE\" rule of bulking supplements because many people assume that ingesting other substances and adding them to your diet is better than taking one whole supplement. But, in fact, ingesting several substances is much more effective in terms of the Creatine Monohydrate, best bulking on steroids. Additionally, creatine needs an appropriate heat source for it to work properly. If you heat your creatine, you are more than likely creating more waste in your body that isn't needed. This is why I recommend using a cool bottle and/or measuring spoons when using creatine, steroids list bulking best. Creatine Monohydrate is also available as a powder; it might not be as effective, but it is a cheap way to ensure that you are getting all the Creatine Monohydrate that you need to replenish your ATP stores. Carnitine Carnitine is a powerful compound that has a great benefit for the bodies of athletes, best bulking steroids list. Because it's not the same as creatine , however, it isn't as effective for bulking. Carnitine works primarily to help the body utilize carbohydrates, which means it will do more good to an athlete during training than during a game.

In a study of insulin sensitivity among 400 lean, healthy, 20-year-old individuals, 13carbon NMR was used to measure glycogen, proton NMR to measure intracellular fat, and magnetic resonance imaging to quantitate visceral fat (40). There were no differences in intra-abdominal fat between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant individuals, but insulin levels after a carbohydrate load markedly differed, with the insulin-resistant group forming less muscle glycogen and markedly more hepatic triglyceride, increased de novo lipogenesis, and an association with increased circulating triglyceride and reduced HDL cholesterol levels. These abnormalities normalize with exercise (41). Shulman pointed out that IFG and IGT may have different determinants, with fasting hyperglycemia caused by increased hepatic gluconeogenesis while postload hyperglycemia reflects a reduction in glucose uptake by liver and muscle.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Clearly, the range of philosophical issues raised by the New Atheists’ claims and arguments is broad. As might be expected, attention has been focused on their epistemological views, their metaphysical assumptions, and their axiological positions. Their presuppositions should prompt more discussion in the fields of philosophical theology, philosophy of science, philosophical hermeneutics, the relation between science and religion, and historiography. Conversations about the New Atheists’ stances and rationales have also taken place in the form of debates between Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, and Dennett and defenders of religious belief and religion such as Dinesh D’Souza, who has published his own defense of Christianity in response to the New Atheists’ arguments. These debates are accessible in a number of places on the Internet. Finally, the challenges to religion posed by the New Atheists have also prompted a number of seminars and conferences. One of these is a conference presented by the Center for Philosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame, entitled, “My Ways Are Not Your Ways: The Character of the God of the Hebrew Bible” ( 2009).

{"line": "As a collection of reflections on the ways we construct narratives surrounding nascent fantasies of sex and desire, Crush is important to feminist theorizing through its exposition of the influence of cultural gender norms on our articulations of our sexualities. The editors claim that “these crushes, like prehistoric insects trapped in amber, remind us of who we were, in all our brace-faced, unencumbered glory, when anything and every was both possible and futile,” but the collective voices evidence gaps in girls’ access to corporeality of fantasy, rather than simply the emotional pleasures of romance. Was everything ever possible for the girls, even in their private daydreams? In her book, Precarious Life: The Power of Mourning and Violence, Judith Butler writes “we’re undone by each other,” and fantasies allow us to undo ourselves, by ourselves, through daydreaming of another. But she also warns us that, “the foreclosure of fantasy—through censorship, degradation, or other means—is one strategy for providing for the social death of person.” Why does society give room for boys’ sexual fantasies but forsake girls? We know girls are fantasizing, learning about sex, and masturbating—so why can’t girls claim their fleshy fantasies? To lift the censorship, degradation, and foreclosure of girls’ fantasies, we may have to investigate the gendered limitations on how we think about early loves, impulses, celebrity crushes, and maybe, sexually stirring gentleman pirates.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

The response of living human nasal cells (RPMI 2650) and human lung cells (A549) towards the direct exposure of gaseous substances for 10 min is monitored with a multiparametric sensor system. Changes in the cellular impedance, oxygen consumption rate and acidification rate can be recorded after the exposure and represent the cytotoxicity of the present gas. The sensor is able to notify the presence of acetone in aqueous solution (2%) but in notably lower concentrations in the gas phase (100-333 ppm) within 30-60 min after the end of the gas exposure. Cell viability is not affected by a sequential exposure to humidified synthetic air (60% r.h.) with a flow rate of 300 ml/min and therefore offers the possibility for a continuous air monitoring. In addition, exposure to synthetic air has no influence on the signals of consecutive acetone exposure. The system might be used in the future for the monitoring of ambient air in work spaces.

Documents discovered by the German historian Fritz Fischer have suggested that in the event of a German victory, one policy under discussion by the German government as part of its Septemberprogramm was to annex a strip of Poland, and replace the population with Germans to set up a defensive barrier in the east. The popularion policy was never officially adopted nor put into effect. The significance of Fischer's discovery, as the Australian historian John Moses has noted, is that the goal of winning lebensraum was already in German thinking long before 1933 and thus cannot be seen, as some German historians have argued, as solely Adolf Hitler's personal brain-child. The \"September plan\" was a proposal that was under discussion but was never adopted and no movement of people was ever ordered. As historian Raffael Scheck concluded, \"The government, finally, never committed itself to anything. It had ordered the September Program as an informal hearing in order to learn about the opinion of the economic and military elites.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}

To explain, looking again at FIG. 5, the image of the fingerprint ridge 69 is shifted by a distance x. Because the image-shift x is different for the different angles of light incident on the finger, a point on a ridge 69 will imaged as a small line parallel to the finger. Such linear smearing is directly proportional to the thickness of the holographic phase grating, and therefore, can be reduced by using a thin hologram phase grating plates, preferably less than 0.3 mm thick. With a thin hologram phase grating 14, diffuse illumination can produce fingerprint image quality approaching that obtained with collimated illumination. Diffuse illumination has an added advantage in that the latent prints of previous users are hardly noticeable (See FIG. 7d). Also, with diffuse illumination, the fingerprint can be viewed with the naked eye without danger of eye damage over a large field of view.

More than 1.7 million new infections and about 39,000 additional deaths were recorded during the past week, as the World Health Organization stated in its latest report. The rates for the week ending on August 23 showed a 5 percent decrease in the number of injuries in the world and a 12 percent decrease in the number of deaths, compared to the previous week. Despite this slowdown, the number of cases of the epidemic reached 23 million and deaths more than 813,000, according to the Associated Press. With the exception of Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, all regions recorded a decrease in the number of new injuries and deaths, according to the organization. The Americas remain by far the most affected regions in the world, as last week they recorded more than half of new infections globally and 62 percent of deaths.

A melodic piece with considerable syncopation, it was an excellent vehicle for demonstrating the fine tone of the string section and the skill of the 7-strong percussion section, including a marimba and synthesiser. The percussionists were also outstanding in the work that opened the second half of the concert, the Hary Janos Suite by the Hungarian-born Zoltan Kodaly. This delightful composition comprises six movements and depicts the tall stories told by the eponymous hero in his local village inn. The orchestra was able to put over not only Kodaly’s lyricism (particularly in the third movement Song, containing a solo for viola exquisitely played by Rebecca Betambeau) and his beloved folk melodies, including a leading part for the cimbalom, but also allowed the humour and wit of the pieces to shine through.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

The ascendance of the Federalists to power in the 1790s thus becomes a hostile takeover of the Revolution by corrupt courtiers and moneymen (Hamilton is the chief culprit), which is eventually defeated and the true spirit of the Revolution recovered by the triumph of the Republicans in the elections of 1800. The core revolutionary principle according to this interpretive tradition is individual liberty. It has radical and, in modern terms, libertarian implications, because it regards any accommodation of personal freedom to governmental discipline as dangerous. In its more extreme forms it is a recipe for anarchy, and its attitude toward any energetic expression of centralized political power can assume paranoid proportions.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Staying at a monastery on the banks of the Irrawaddy River, we got up every day before dawn to make food offerings to the lines of monks walking by. My siblings and I did this as a way ofmaking merit for our late parents, who passed away while I was in exile. I was also honoring my former friends and colleagues who gave up their lives for the pro-democracy cause. A few years ago the junta forced the monks and villagers to move away from Pagan and as a result the monks now find it harder to get food. We were happy to do whatever we could to make up for the shortfall. Offering food to those in need and sharing merit with those to whom I owe so much always fills me with bliss.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "We believe God instituted for His church two ordinances to represent Christ and His benefits and to confirm our interest in Him (I Co. 10:16; Ga. 3:27). These two ordinances are baptism and the Lord’s Supper. They were instituted by Jesus Christ and are only for the saved (Act. 8:12; I Co. 11:27). Baptism is a symbol of the work of regeneration performed by God in the believer’s life and the giving of one’s self to God to live in newness of life (Col. 2:12; Mk. 1:4; Rom. 6:3-4). Baptism should be celebrated in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Jo 1:33; Mat. 28:19,20). The exterior element of this ordinance is the water. Because baptism is to represent the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, only the complete immersion of the body in water can fulfil the God given requirements for this ordinance (Mat. 3:16; Act. 8:39). Our Lord, on the night He was betrayed, instituted the ordinance of His body and blood called the Lord’s Supper to be observed in His church until the end of time. It is a symbol of the sacrifice of Himself in His death (I Co. 11:23-26). The exterior elements used in this ordinance are the bread and the cup and, since they represent the sinless body and blood of Christ being given for all men, these should be free of leaven, the symbol for sin (Lk. 22:19,20; I Co. 5:6-8).", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Look, as Dolphins fans we have seen this song and dance before where the front office totally ignores the position and puts way too much faith in bad players like Billy Turner, Dallas Thomas, and Jamil Douglas. Those three guys can't play in this league. I don't need to see any more of them to know that. If the Fins are banking on any one of them to do anything then this franchise is hopeless. I can understand again the Fins didn't want to break the bank for a guy like Alex Boone, I get it. He got a deal nobody saw coming and Fins didn't want to pay that much for a guard. But the Fins have to do something and signing an old broken down tackle coming off a major injury who has never played guard before and expecting him to solve this issue is beyond stupid. I mean its really really stupid. Like 2 + 2 =9 stupid! Jermon Bushrod is an old back-up tackle at best these days if he is even healthy. Again, the Fins cant' fix every hole on their roster. Go sign a vet guard on a 1 year deal (there are still a lot of capable guys out there) and take the need to draft a guard off the table entering the draft completely.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

The Duke staff likes to move the tight end around in their offense, and the versatility of Huffman and King allowed them to thrive in multiple roles. While Huffman and King assumed roles as the unheralded warriors of the Duke offense, junior college transfer Cooper Helfet emerged as another potent weapon in Sean Renfree’s arsenal. After struggling with an ankle injury early in the season, Helfet finished the year with at least 4 catches in Duke’s final 5 games, leading the team in receiving in two contests and earning two ACC Player of the Week honors.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

By the film’s halfway point, the movie shifts to the battlefront in the taken of Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa and it’s one of the hellish and brutal depictions in recent movie history. Guns are blazing, bombs are bursting, bodies are falling, and the carnage is elevated to its maximum level, swirling all around the character of Desmond Doss as he carefully navigates the battlefield. Think of the opening D-Day battle sequence in Saving Private Ryan (intense and bloody) and that’s what you get in the second half of Hacksaw Ridge. Personally, I loved it. My heart was racing and my intensity level was dialed up to 10! It definitely worked well to counterbalance the more lighthearted moments in the film’s first act. Gibson doesn’t “romance” the film’s war premise (this isn’t a kind-hearted History Channel presentation), but rather goes for dramatic realism of the decisive taking of the ridge and the complete nightmarish battle that takes place there. In short, this movie isn’t for the faint of heart, so if you’re queasy or uneasy about the dramatic portrayals of war, violence, and blood, then Hacksaw Ridge might not be towards your liking.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Me and my girlfriend went and paid fifty-five dollars apiece to “learn the secrets of bending spoons,” and they show up and hand us forks. I was like “Wait a minute, this is supposed to be spoon bending, not fork bending.” Anyway, he showed us these techniques and they all worked, but the way that they worked was basically through the powers of suggestion. There’s sixteen-people in this circle, we’ve all got forks, people have their eyes closed, and I opened my eyes because I’m basically there as a spy. Across the circle from me, there’s a woman just bending the hell out of her fork. Eventually, we all open our eyes and the teacher said, “How did it go?”, and this one woman raises her hand and says, “Um, I don’t know. I just felt the warmth roll through me. This energy, the arcturian light, flowed through my body and look, I have this bent fork.” And then, it was game on. Everybody in the circle closed their eyes again and trying different techniques, and everyone is bending forks all around this circle. By the end of the two-and-a-half-hour seminar, people are getting so fast at bending the forks… They weren’t doing it insincerely, they weren’t trying to fool each other, but they wanted to participate. They wanted to feel special.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "The granules are made by coating conductive particles with a layer of polymer in a controlled mixing regime that imparts only sufficient force to the components of the mix to achieve the coating process and avoids additional force which has been found to have a degrading effect on the electrical properties of the final polymer composition. The relationship between filler, binder, mixing energy, time, rate of shear, temperature and pressure determine the particle size-distribution and electromechanical properties of the resulting granule. It appears likely that the conductor particles act as nuclei for granule formation. Such mixing is preferably at a low level of shear, so that the conductor particles remain structurally intact. Suitably a dish-granulator, blunger, coaxial cylinder mixer (rotary ablation) can be used. In the granule-forming step it appears that the total shear can be of the same order as in the production of bulk composition but applied at greater intensity for a shorter time. Granule formation is preferably accompanied by some cross-linking of the polymer. The polymer formulation is chosen and the conditions of mixing are controlled so that breakage of the mixture into granules is synchronized with cross-linkage of the polymer sufficient for a non-sticky state. This is especially convenient using RTV silicone. The process may if desired be controlled to produce a precursor of the granules in which the polymer may be subjected to further cross-linking to develop elastomerism. Use of HTV silicone affords more scope in making such precursors. The silicone very suitably is one subject to high shrinkage for example by 10-20% on cross-linking. This makes possible a relatively high conductor to polymer volume ratio in granules without an inconveniently high ratio at the start of mixing.", "label": "Technical Specifications and Metadata", "split": false}

Questions of cultural difference, identity and otherness—in a word, ethnicity—have been thrown into the foreground of contestation and debate by numerous shifts and developments. Within the British context, these trends have underpinned controversies around recent independent films like Handsworth Songs, My Beautiful Laundrette and The Passion of Remembrance—films which have elicited critical acclaim and angry polemic in roughly equal measure. The fragmented state of the nation depicted from a black British point of view in the films themselves contradicts (literally, speaks against) the remythification of the colonial past in mainstream movies such as Ghandi or A Passage to India; yet, the wave of popular films set in imperial India or Africa also acknowledge, in their own way, Britain’s postcolonial condition in so far as they speak to contemporary concerns.

It argues that historically, the pragmatic and gradualist rejection of utopia has been anti-utopian in effect, notably in the case of Popper. More recent attempts to argue in favour of \"realistic utopianism\" or its equivalent, by writers such as Wallerstein and Rorty are also profoundly anti-utopian, despite Rorty's commitment to \"social hope\". They co-opt the terminology of utopia to positions that are antagonistic to radical alterity. But this is not a necessary response to the utopia/pragmatism tension: Unger, who is explicitly opposed to utopia, in fact proffers a more sympathetic resolution based on the merits of vision, social improvization and collective learning. These may lie closer to the core of the utopian project as a vehicle for the education of desire than Unger himself recognizes.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "At 123 minutes and—in its physical form—three CDs long, Éons, the new album from Belgium’s Neptunian Maximalism, is unquestionably a massive work. Even so, the size and scale of the project—formed in 2018 by multi-instrumentalist Guillaume Cazalet and saxophonist Jean-Jacques Duerinckx—never feels unnecessary or extravagant as this aptly named collective uses the healthy runtime to explore heavy psych, tribal rhythms, free-jazz freakouts, meditative drone and the vast, shadowy spaces in between. Arriving in the wake of a four-song EP and a largely improvised live album that hinted at Neptunian Maximalism’s ambition, Éons fully delivers on those early promises. The sonic epic not only gives the band plenty of room to roam, but also follows a conceptual framework that imagines the end of Earth’s human-dominated anthropocene era and the onset of a ‘probocene’ era, in which the planet is ruled by superior, intelligent elephants.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "To overcome the legal shock, the Regole began a process of resistance, reclaiming ownership and statutory autonomy. The matter was first heard by the commons commissioner for the provinces of Trento, Bolzano, and Belluno. Commons commissioners were a statutory body established in 1927 to determine the ownership of the commons and settled related disputes. With the order (sentenza) 24.10/27.12.1947 the commons commissioner declared that the ownership of the Regole’s lands was to pass to the municipality and this implied that they become subject to the uses of the whole municipality of Cortina, rather than only of the traditional holders of rights of common. After losing in the Court of Appeal, the Regole referred the matter to the Supreme Court of Cassation but the appeal was abandoned when the municipality of Cortina and the Regole achieved a compromise in 1957 approved by the city council whereby around 1500 ha of lands were assigned to the municipality and almost 17,000 ha to the Regole (Romagnoli 1986). Therefore, the key variable that transformed the relationship from a difficult to a harmonious one was the Regole’s bottom-up legal resistance to the juridical wall created by the 1927 law. The statutory autonomy of common properties was then recognized by different national property laws, such as the law n. 1102 of 3 December 1971 and the law n. 97 of 31 January 1994 that I discuss below.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "ABSTRACT: An in situ experimental assessment was made of the effects of the interaction between spectral composition of solar radiation and the limiting nutrient (phosphorous, P) on the algae-bacteria link, measured over the short term (1.5 h after P enrichment) in an oligotrophic and autotrophic high mountain lake. Variables related to the metabolism of algae (primary production, excretion of photosynthetic carbon) and bacteria (bacterial production, percentages of photosynthetic exudates assimilated and used for bacterial production) were studied. P enrichment suppressed or attenuated the negative effects exerted by ultraviolet radiation on algae when their elemental composition was P deficient. This was reflected in antagonistic interactive effects between P enrichment and solar radiation (P X R), which were triggered by a decrease in primary production and an increase in organic carbon excretion due to metabolic adjustments to growth. P enrichment also suppressed or attenuated the main effects exerted by ultraviolet radiation on bacteria. This was reflected in antagonistic P X R interactive effects triggered by an enhancement of the dual control (resource and predation) that algae exerted on bacteria and by the growth stimulation of P-deficient bacteria after P enrichment. All of these observed responses contribute to improving the food quality for herbivores and reinforce the flux of carbon and nutrient to the grazing chain, which explains its development in this and other clear-water ecosystems.", "label": "Bibliographical and Citation References", "split": false}

The step 110 of providing a housing and the step 120 of mounting LEDs 12 to circuit board 20 in an array are followed by mounting the circuit board in the housing shown as step 130. As mentioned earlier, such mounting in one preferred embodiment is accomplished by snapping fitting 24 into the bottom 10a of the housing with circuit board 20 resting circumferentially on the stepped shelf in the housing. The next step 140 is to pour liquid resin with the metallic particles suspended therein into the housing to embed the circuit board 20 in the resin. In one preferred embodiment, several openings 36 (see FIG. 3) are provided completely through circuit board 20 to allow liquid resin to flow through such openings and substantially completely fill the space between copper layer 26 of the circuit board and the bottom 10a of the housing. Moreover, a sufficient amount of resin is, in a preferred embodiment, provided to permit a layer of resin to be disposed on the front surface 20a of the circuit board 20 and interstitially between the LEDs. In an alternative embodiment, in some situations it may be acceptable and/or desirable not to provide such resin on the front surface 20a of the circuit board, but rather only along the back surface of the circuit board defined by copper layer 26. Also, while not preferred, the resin on the front surface may be separately formed without the heat conductive particles whereas the matrix on the back surface would have such particles embedded therein.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

What is not permanent is not worth striving for. So I say the Self is not reached. You are the Self, you are already that. The fact is, you are ignorant of your blissful state. Ignorance supervenes and draws a veil over the pure Self which is bliss. Attempts are directed only to remove this veil of ignorance which is merely wrong knowledge. The wrong knowledge is the false identification of the Self with the body and the mind. This false identification must go, and then the Self alone remains.

For the Preacher loved life, and did not want to die, saying, ‘For a living dog is better than a dead lion.’ He preferred the vanity and vexation to the silence and unmovableness of the grave. And so I. To crawl is piggish; but to not crawl, to be as the clod and rock, is loathsome to contemplate.

{"line": "We allow each node to choose different probabilities according to its distance from the sender. The distance from the sender to a node can be calculated from the sender’s transmission power level or global positioning system (GPS). In short, with our approach, each node examines how far it is from sender and determines its retransmission probability. It is better for the node that is further from the sender to have a high retransmission probability than to have a low probability. This means that a node that is geographically further from the sender may potentially act as a relay node for a node that is closer to the sender. Note that a node close to the sender might be selfish and alleviated from the rebroadcast burden in the extreme case. The advantage of the concept of selfishness is that the total rebroadcast traffic may be reduced. The drawback of this concept is that the network reachability may be adversely affected if all of the nodes in any cut set of the MANET graph are assigned to be selfish.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "In this thesis, I examine a line of thought that stretches from Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860), who regarded his own work merely as an interpretation and continuation Immanuel Kant’s (1724-1804) philosophy, through Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), who reacted to Schopenhauer’s negation of life with an affirmative philosophy, to Thomas Mann (1875-1955), who, operating from within this tradition, attempted a synthesis of it as well as a critical analysis of some of its aspects and their relation to seemingly-pathological fascistic sentiment he witnessed in the Germany of the 1920s and 30s. This line of thought deals with the essential question of Life. It addresses: questions of the relation of the body to the physical world; interpretations of bodily suffering, Death, and a sympathy with Death, called \"Romanticism.\" Through this examination, I discuss, in order: Schopenhauer's system at length, as presented in The World as Will and Representation, and the bodily emphasis found therein; Nietzsche's philosophy, its essential character as being both a reaction to and inverse of Schopenhauerianism, exhibited in Nietzsche's identification of Schopenhauer's latent Romanticism as a \"sickness\" in The Gay Science, and his increasing focus on this idea of physiological-philosophical sickness in his later works -- which as a totalizing idea can be seen to encompass all his major notions, including the Will to Power and Amor Fati, for example; and finally Mann's work within this tradition, regarding a philosophical synthesis of it in The Magic Mountain and in his address \"An Appeal to Reason,\" given at the Beethovensaal the night following the 1930 German elections. Ultimately, and most importantly, this thesis asks: what is the meaning of physiological-philosophical health, in the exceptional sense of the term, and what is the consequence of its opposite, a sickness in respect to life itself?", "label": "clean", "split": false}

In a discussion of “global threats,” Coats adopted language similar to the NDS to note that “terrorism remains a persistent threat and in some ways is positioned to increase in 2019.” He also explained that the conflicts in Iraq and Syria have “generated a large pool of skilled and battle-hardened fighters who remain dispersed throughout the region.” However, he did not single out the Islamic State as a particular concern. When he did mention the group, he noted that it “has returned to its guerilla-warfare roots,” is “continuing to plot attacks and direct its supporters worldwide,” and “is intent on resurging and still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria.” Noting the Islamic State’s intentions is important, and the fact that it commands fighters in a regional conflict is helpful context, but these factors do not indicate the relative threat it poses.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Still exhibiting class-consciousness, it was at the roots of the modernists rejection of tradition.

{"line": "The invention provides a method of making the granules by mixing conductor particles with liquid-form polymer in granule-forming conditions. The liquid-form polymer may be, for example, a precursor subject to polymerization or to cross-linking during the granule-forming step or later. Liquid-form means sufficiently flowable to undergo mixing with the conductor particles. The polymer may be very viscous. A liquid may be present to modify the viscosity of the polymer as an aid to mixing. It may be added, for example, by pre-mixing with the polymer or with the conductor powder. The liquid should of course be chemically inert with respect to the conductor and polymer. Preferably it is volatile, that is, has an atmospheric pressure boiling point under 120° C., to assist removal during and after mixing. Hydrocarbons, such as petroleum distillates, are very suitable. Before or during mixing there may be added a hydrophobising agent. This is believed to act by displacing adsorbed water from the surfaces of the components of the mix, for example the conductor particles, solid additives such as those described below, especially fumed silica, and possibly of newly exposed polymer and newly formed granules. The agent may also act as a lubricant limiting friction-at mixer surfaces. Since it can act by formation of very thin, even unimolecular layers, the quantity to be used is very small, for example 10-1000 ppm w/w of the mix. Examples of the agent are liquid hydrocarbons carrying groups favouring chemisorption on metals, and fluorocarbons.", "label": "Technical Specifications and Metadata", "split": false}

{"line": "In 2002, the movie Hero became an instant hit in China, where it was made by Zhang Yimou, perhaps the best-known Chinese director. When it opened in America last year–complete with an above-the-title imprimatur by haute auteur Quentin Tarantino–it was billed as an action-romance of the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon variety, complete with wire-guided swordfights and a melodramatic ménage-a-trois love angle. Yet, in addition to being a piece of post-modern eye candy, the film had a distinctly pre-modern theme: the glories of Chinese nationalism. The movie’s central plot swirls around martial arts master Jet Li’s decision to abandon his mission to kill the Qin emperor, who is marching his army to conquer Jet Li’s homeland of Zhao. The hero recognizes that the establishment of “our land”–greater, imperial China–is a cause far greater than the enslavement of his native people. As New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis (a student of the Maureen Dowd school) summed up Hero‘s message: “Roll over, Chairman Mao, and tell the comrades the news: the history of the empire now comes wrapped in kaleidoscopic kung fu cool.”", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "Rousseau reached Paris when he was 30 and was lucky enough to meet another young man from the provinces seeking literary fame in the capital, Denis Diderot. The two soon became immensely successful as the centre of a group of intellectuals—or philosophes—who gathered round the great French Encyclopédie, of which Diderot was appointed editor. The Encyclopédie was an important organ of radical and anticlerical opinion, and its contributors were as much reforming and even iconoclastic pamphleteers as they were philosophers. Rousseau, the most original of them all in his thinking and the most forceful and eloquent in his style of writing, was soon also the most conspicuous. He wrote music as well as prose, and one of his operas, Le Devin du village (1752; “The Village Soothsayer”), attracted so much admiration from the king (Louis XV) and the court that he might have enjoyed an easy life as a fashionable composer, but something in his Calvinist blood rejected that type of worldly glory. Indeed, at the age of 37 Rousseau had what he called an “illumination” while walking to Vincennes to visit Diderot, who had been imprisoned there because of his irreligious writings. In the Confessions (1782–89), which he wrote late in life, Rousseau says that it came to him then in a “terrible flash” that modern progress had corrupted people instead of improving them. He went on to write his first important work, a prize essay for the Academy of Dijon entitled Discours sur les sciences et les arts (1750; A Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts), in which he argues that the history of human life on earth has been a history of decay.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

While older flapjack recipes call for ‘jumbo’ oats which are oats which have been rolled, but not cut before-hand. However, as it turns out, to get the best texture in your flapjack you should use a mixture of these quicker cooked regular porridge oats and the slower to cook jumbo oats.

Elad has its hooks in Charley, and what was once fantasy has become deadly reality for both the artist and the woman she loves. “The Margins is an amazingly original and insightful look into the creative process,” says Fanbase Press President Bryant Dillon. “David, Paul, and Amanda do an incredible job of exploring the motivations that can cause a creator get lost within their own imagina-tion, all while taking us on a thrilling and fascinating fantasy journey.” The Margins is currently available for pre-order through the Fanbase Press website (www.fanbasepress.com), and the graphic novel will be released for sale on July 23, 2018.

Because the colours for sources such as Twitter and Facebook correspond to the platforms’ logo colours, the donut is both an aesthetically pleasing infographic and a way of showcasing the online attention papers have received in one easy click. For Steve Davis, adding the data to his online profile saved him time and allowed him to display attention from a range of sources simultaneously, rather than through manual recording; “I have in the past curated my own list of news outlets and blogs that have covered my work in order to track what kind of reaction it was getting”. Davis also said the data prompted him to think about social media monitoring, which he had not been doing previously. James Grecian said he found Altmetric provided “a useful way to curate and link to the media articles that mention my research”, and also commented that he found the badges easy to use.

In areas corresponding to valleys and pores of the finger surface not in contact with the grating surface, the illuminating light is totally internally reflected.

In particular, the holographic phase grating eliminates image distortion due to dimensional compression. And, because the waveform of the image within and emerging from the invented sensor is planar, there is no necessity for optically correcting for astigmatism before recording the image electronically or in film.

I like the way you give the events on the North Tower from Malfoy's perspective, it does give some interesting insight into his personality as you have written him. However, thre are a couple of spots where Malfoy has a pretty good sized chunk of dialogue which ends with a line of dialogue by Hermione. It might be a little less confusing if you give Hermione's dialogue it's own paragraph, even if that means the paragraph is only one sentence long. For example, you can split this paragraph (which needs quotation marks at the beginning), ‘Then, I was actually there, with Dumbledore, and he was not quite right. He was weak but he was talking, talking too much. He wasn’t afraid of me. He wasn’t afraid in the least. Then he told me that I wasn’t a killer. I was so stupid; I was actually insulted even though I knew it was true. I knew, right at that moment, that I couldn’t do what they expected me to do. I was going to fail. I tried to fight it. I didn’t want to die because I couldn’t do it. Dumbledore offered me help, but how could I take it when I knew I was going to die for not killing the man who was trying to help me?! Then the rest of them showed up, and they taunted me to try to get me to do it. My hands were shaking so bad I couldn’t even aim my wand. Dumbledore actually smiled at me once or twice. Then Snape came in and he did it. Then, Dumbledore just fell over the side of the tower.” He stopped speaking and blinked his eyes several times. The tears had not fallen, though they still glimmered in the corners of his eyes. Hermione felt her own eyes welling up as she looked at him. She breathed heavily and blinked them away. “What happened after you left Hogwarts? Why are you here?”' I would split it right when you start talking about Hermione feeling tears in her eyes. As you're shifting the focus from Draco to Hermione, you can split the paragraph without really doing anything to flow of the overall story. Anyway, that's just a suggestion.

I’d tried matte and semi-matte lipsticks like Mac’s Ruby Woo before, but they don’t quite give the same super bold, super opaque effect as the liquid matte products. I’m still an advocate of the Limecrime Velvetine, but at £13.50 plus shipping they’re not cheap and they can’t be bought in store in the UK. Consequently, I was keen to try out some more affordable high street alternatives, especially as they’re becoming more and more popular at the moment.

One of the greatest private holdings of early Meissen assembled in the twentieth century, the collection was formed in two phases, the first in Dresden between 1926 and 1935 by Henry's parents, Lisa (née Mattersdorff; 1890–1972) and Heinrich (1885–1935) Arnhold; the second, by Henry in New York between 1972 and 2006. Heinrich Arnhold, trained as a lawyer and a member of a powerful banking family in Dresden, and his wife, who had studied medicine, were married in 1914 and became deeply involved in the cultural and intellectual life of the city. Their interest in collecting porcelain may have stemmed, in part, from the fact that Heinrich served on the boards of thirteen porcelain and ceramic firms in Saxony with which his bank was affiliated. He and Lisa began by making a few tentative purchases of porcelain, which were later sold, before deciding to focus on the acquisition of pieces from the early period at Meissen, choosing, almost exclusively, wares and vases rather than figures. The collection grew to include large vases, pieces from table services, as well as tea, coffee, and chocolate services.

Then during the New Kingdom (1580-1085 BC) they were used during festivals and Egyptian women also used perfumed creams and oils as toiletries and cosmetics and as preludes to love-making. The use of perfume then spread to Greece, Rome, and the Islamic world. And it was the Islamic community that kept the use of perfumes since the spread of Christianity led to a decline in the use of perfume.
