Should the mains power supply fail or fluctuate, the inverter is supplied DC power from the battery set. Capacitance within the UPS is used to ensure a ‘no-break’ supply to the input of the inverter section and the load is supplied a pure and uninterrupted supply. An on-line UPS also features a built-in automatic bypass switch. Should the inverter output waveform start to collapse due to an internal fault or overload short circuit, the bypass switch instantaneously transfers the connected load to mains power or generator supply (whichever is present).", "label": "clean", "split": false}

This area has granite rocks of different abilities but it’s at an altitude of over 1600 meters so you’ll need to go in milder weather (summer). It’s known locally as “the chaos” and is considered the second best location for bouldering after Fontainebleau.

{"line": "In a measure the aggressions of the later Popes in their own persons had ceased, and were carried on only by means of missionaries. But lately, Pius IX., becoming Bishop of Rome and proclaimed Pope in 1847, published on the sixth of January, in this present year, an Encyclical Letter addressed to the Easterns, consisting of twelve pages in the Greek version, which his emissary has disseminated, like a plague coming from without, within our Orthodox Fold...Usurping as his own possession the Catholic Church of Christ, by occupancy, as he boasts, of the Episcopal Throne of St. Peter, he desires to deceive the more simple into apostasy from Orthodoxy, choosing for the basis of all theological instruction these paradoxical words (p. 10, 1.29): \"nor is there any reason why ye refuse a return to the true Church and Communion with this my holy Throne\"...As to the supremacy, since we are not setting forth a treatise, let the same great Basil present the matter in a f'ew words, \"I preferred to address myself to Him who is Head over them.\"..For all this we have esteemed it our paternal and brotherly need, and a sacred duty, by our present admonition to confirm you in the Orthodoxy you hold from your forefathers, and at the same time point out the emptiness of the syllogisms of the Bishop of Rome, of which he is manifestly himself aware. For not from his Apostolic Confession does he glorify his Throne, but from his Apostolic Throne seeks to establish his dignity, and from his dignity, his Confession. The truth is the other way...But, finally, his Holiness says (p. ix. l.12) that the fourth Ecumenical Council (which by mistake he quite transfers from Chalcedon to Carthage), when it read the epistle of Pope Leo I, cried out, \"Peter has thus spoken by Leo.\" It was so indeed. But his Holiness ought not to overlook how, and after what examination, our fathers cried out, as they did, in praise of Leo...Of more than six hundred fathers assembled in the Counci1 of Chalcedon, about two hundred of the wisest were appointed by the Council to examine both as to language and sense the said epistle of Leo; nor only so, but to give in writing and with their signatures their own judgment upon it, whether it were orthodox or not...And thus all in succession: \"The epistle corresponds,\" \"the epistle is consonant,\"the epistle agrees in sense,\" and the like. After such great and very severe scrutiny in comparing it with former holy Councils, and a full conviction of the correctness of the meaning, and not merely because it was the epistle of the Pope, they cried aloud, ungrudgingly, the exclamation on which his Holiness now vaunts himself: But if his Holiness had sent us statements concordant and in unison with the seven holy Ecumenical Councils, instead of boasting of the piety of his predecessors lauded by our predecessors and fathers in an Ecumenical Council, he might justly have gloried in his own orthodoxy, declaring his own goodness instead of that of his fathers. Therefore let his Holiness be assured, that if, even now, he will write us such things as two hundred fathers on investigation and inquiry shall find consonant and agreeing with the said former Councils, then, we say, he shall hear from us sinners today, not only, \"Peter has so spoken,\" or anything of like honor, but this also, \"Let the holy hand be kissed which has wiped away the tears of the Catholic Church.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "Born in Mexico towards the close of the seventeenth century; died 29 January, 1763. He received his education in the Jesuit College of San Ildefonso of Mexico and later was named rector of the University of Mexico. His learning was extensive, covering theology, canon law, philosophy, mathematics, and letters, to which was added an exceptional gift of oratory. Resenting the levity with which the famous Dean of Alicante, Manuel Martí, had characterized the attainments of the men of letters of the New World in his \"epistolas latinas\" printed in Madrid in 1735, denying them any merit, Eguiara, determined to vindicate the honour of his compatriots, began his work \"Biblioteca Mexicana\". He gave it this name because of his love of Mexico and thereby incurred the ill-will of the other Spanish-American provinces. He published the first volume, which comprised the letters A, B, and C, and left in manuscript many biographies down to J. In the preface he refutes the charges of Dean Martí with much spirit and patriotism. The \"Biblioteca Mexicana\" is written in Latin and, besides the fact that it is incomplete, a certain pomposity of style detracts from its merits. Notwithstanding this it has been extremely valuable, being the first work of its kind published in Mexico and perhaps in the whole of Spanish-America. Eguiara was elected Bishop of Yucatán, but resigned the dignity to continue his literary work. Besides the work already mentioned, the complete title of which is \"Biblioteca Mexicana sive eruditorum historia virorum qui in America Boreali nati, vel alibi geniti, in ipsam domicilio aut studiis asciti, quavis lingua scripto aliquid tradiderunt. Ferdinando VI Hispaniarum Regi Catholico, Nuncupata Mexici 1755\", he published \"Panegiricos\", printed separately in Mexico (1727-57); \"Elogios fúnebres\" (1755-66); \"Praelectiones\" (Mexico, 1746); fourteen volumes in theological and juridical questions; twenty volumes of sermons and instructions; and several other treatises.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Over a six-month period, the Flying Tigers destroyed 296 enemy planes and Jernstedt is credited with shooting down more than 10 of these craft. Following his military duties, Jernstedt went on to a life of public service, taking on the role of an Oregon state representative for two years before being elected to the state Senate, where he served for 20 years.

{"line": "We transfected BV-2 cell line with two different MVK specific siRNA sequences (8b and 8c) and evaluated MVK mRNA and protein expression (Figure 1). After different time-course experiments (data not shown) we found that at 72h post-transfection MVK mRNA was reduced 10-fold in cells treated with 8b siRNA and 6-fold with 8c siRNA (Figure 1a, left). Correspondingly we found 40% reduction in MVK protein in 8b cells and 20% reduction in 8c cells (Figure 1b and c). In parallel, we evaluated the expression of NALP3, a key component of inflammasome pathway. Interestingly we found that neither mRNA levels nor protein levels were influenced by MVK silencing (Figure 1a, right, b and d). In addition we measured caspase-1 activity to confirm that inflammasome platform was not activated. We found that siRNA treatment did not significantly increase caspase-1 activity 72h after transfection compared to untreated cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1a). Moreover, we found that lowering MVK expression does not cause programmed cell death, as assessed by Propidium Iodide (PI) and Annex V (AnnV) staining. Using flow cytometry we found that untreated cells have 15.32 ± 1.32% double positive cell (positive for PI and AnnV), cells transfected with a “scrambled” (SCR) sequence have 14.08 ± 0.7% double positive, 8b transfected have 19.02 ± 0.96% and 8c transfected have 17.12 ± 1.04 double positive cells. The small differences in percentage are not significant with p < 0.05 (data not shown). We also tried to determine if the effect of lowering MVK expression could be more significant after LPS treatment, used as a trigger for inflammasome platform activation. We then examined caspase-1 activity in siRNA cells, and we found that LPS treatment increased caspase-1 activity with all the different transfections, i.e. “scrambled” siRNA or 8b or 8c, although to the same rate, demonstrating once more that lowering MVK protein content does not influence NALP3 activity (Additional file 1: Figure S1b).", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "For designing broadcast protocols in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), one of the important goals is to reduce the rebroadcast packets redundancy while reaching all the nodes in network. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic broadcasting mechanism based on selfishness and additional coverage in MANETs. Our approach dynamically adjusts the rebroadcast probability according to the extra covered area and number of neighbor nodes. By these two factors, mobile hosts can be classified into three groups: normal, low selfishness, and high selfishness groups. The nodes in the normal group forward packets for other nodes with high probability, whereas the nodes in the low selfishness group rebroadcast packets with low probability and the nodes in the high selfishness group do not rebroadcast packets. We compared our approach with simple flooding and the fixed probabilistic approach. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the number of retransmissions by up to 40% compared simple flooding and fixed probabilistic scheme without significant reduction in the network reachability and end-to-end packet delay.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "The other poll result above, about challenging the ruling of the federal judge on gay marriage in Utah, is where the silver lining I mentioned comes in. Even in a state that’s trending towards support for legalizing SSM, people don’t like having the rules made by judges. The Supreme Court is sensitive to that, too. Ruth Bader Ginsburg has grumbled that pro-choicers might have been better off without Roe v. Wade, since that would have left legalization to the states and that would have built a democratic legitimacy for the practice that Roe, to some extent, short-circuited. The Court’s ruling on Prop 8 last year, in which it declined the opportunity to strike down traditional marriage laws across the country, may be an example of the same logic at work. There’s almost no question that SCOTUS will, eventually, legalize gay marriage; there is a question of whether they might hold off for several years if they see the public even in conservative redoubts like Utah shifting their way. Why open itself up to “tyranny of the judiciary” charges if it can sit back and let changing electoral demographics do the job? As such, polls like this might buy more time for other conservative states to keep their marriage laws, even though they almost certainly won’t last forever.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "As a security professional the idea that fear wasn’t the best way to relay information was something that I hadn’t considered before. If you have heard any sort of talk in regards to Computer Security you have heard that a hacker can steal you identity, your bank account and with a little effort your first-born. Okay so I am exaggerating a little but every talk I have given or heard about Computer Security has been about the negative effects of not securing your network. Then after giving presentations about how there is never a secure system they wonder why executives haven’t approved their expanded budgets. I believe we, as security professionals, are going about this all wrong. Instead of focusing on how impossible security is, we need to start focusing on how we can make the network better overall with the enhancements that security brings. In this realm I have found that UX people do a good job for the most part. When they make a presentation about a new website design they don’t sit there and say how little traffic and how confusing the current User Interface (UI) is and then sit down. They quickly go over part of the problems the current UI and then go on to show how well their UI will work and what it can bring to the table. Now this might just be an issue for Security professionals but I have a feeling it isn’t. Overall, as professionals, we need to focus on the idea that has been thrown around this blog, and that is the Value Added principle. Focus on what value you are going to add to the company and how much it will help in the short and long-term.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Again, this is using the scripture to define scripture. Not my reasoning, not current events, nothing but God's word. My hermeneutic is using scripture to interpret scripture. No one has refuted my explanation of the term 'no more', the binding of Satan, or anything else. Again, the 'rule' set up for the interpretation of 'thousand', is not followed in scripture. When my post is waved away, not by bringing me to bar of scripture, but merely labeling it as obfuscation, wrong, or presupposition; I took that as mocking. Forgive me if that was not the intention.

Strips of fabric can be cut and laid in overlapping patterns to achieve the desired configuration, or the required pattern can be cut from a single sheet of fabric.

The specific elastomer selected is preferably based on the simulated physiological structure and the location of the circuit relative to the simulated physiological structure. If the circuit is to be disposed within a simulated tissue structure in a fatty layer, the elastomer selected ought to realistically simulate fat. In a block 461, an upper elastomeric layer is placed over the fabric and the lower elastomeric layer, thereby encapsulating the fabric in an elastomeric matrix. While the upper elastomeric layer will often be identical to the lower elastomeric layer, the present invention is not limited to such a configuration.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "Richard F. Alvidrez is currently Manager of Community College Initiatives within the Education Office at the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. His responsibilities include developing and administering teacher training programs, educator conferences, education materials, and providing education support to JPL's activities such as National Engineers Week, the Education Gateway for Education and Outreach programs, and other programs in JPL's interest. In 1997, he helped develop a program for 30 community colleges, the JPL Undergraduate Scholars (JPLUS) Program, the largest such program among NASA field Centers. He is equally experienced in both K-12 and higher education programs, and has facilitated research fellowships and internships for community college students with JPL or Caltech researchers. Richard entered the engineering profession immediately after a tour of duty with the US Air Force, where he received his first exposure to engineering. He attended Northrop University, and later graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering from UC Santa Barbara. He later added a BA degree in mathematics from California State University, Los Angeles, as his interest changed from engineering to teaching. He recently completed an MS degree in Education with an emphasis on Instructional Technology, from the University of Southern California. Richard has been involved in education for the past 32 years, including teaching mathematics at the middle school, high school, community college, and university levels. For twelve years prior to his current position at JPL, he was Director of the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program at California State University, Los Angeles, where he was responsible for encouraging students from historically underrepresented groups to enter math- and science-related fields of study, such as engineering. Richard is a member of the Executive Steering Committee of the Charter College of Education at California State University, Los Angeles. He remains active in teaching mathematics as an Adjunct Faculty member at Pasadena City College. He has designed and developed assessment tools and taxonomies, and designed a Quality Assurance Rubric for Education for NASA products and programs. He was awarded the first Wilbur H. Somerton award for his work with the MESA program in 1989, and the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Award for Precollege Education in 1991.

Encouraged by activist Margaret Sanger, a woman long committed to a national movement for family planning and the rights of women to control their reproductive lives, the number of active supporters soon swelled. The voices of those who believed that the future lay in teaching society how to make \"every child a wanted child\" grew in both volume and intensity. In 1932, the Massachusetts Mothers Health Council, the organization that would eventually become PPLM, opened its first clinic in Brookline and in five years, there were also clinics in Springfield, Worcester, Boston, New Bedford, Fitchburg and Salem. But by 1937, these seven busy clinics were closed and their staffs convicted of violating the law that prohibited selling or giving away contraceptives. No one then could have imagined how frequently this pattern of events, careening from success to defeat and back again, would repeat itself in the coming decades.

For he feareth lest while he is observing the foul weather, and awaiting sunshine, the time may pass away, and he may not find anything to reap. Put not off, my brethren; sow in wintry weather, sow good works, even while ye weep; for, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.” They sow their seed, good will, and good works. “They went on their way and wept, casting their seed” (Psa. 126.6). Why did they weep? Because they were among the miserable, and were themselves miserable. It is better, my brethren, that no man should be miserable, than that thou shouldest do alms.…Nevertheless, as long as there are objects for its exercise, let us not fail amid those troubles to sow our seed. Although we sow in tears, yet shall we reap in joy. For in that resurrection of the dead, each man shall receive his own sheaves, that is, the produce of his seed, the crown of joys and of delight. Then will there be a joyous triumph, when we shall laugh at death, wherein we groaned before: then shall they say to death, “O death, where is thy strife? O death, where is thy sting?” 5508 But why do they now rejoice? Because “they bring their sheaves with them.”", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "The origin of posh” is obscure.The most seen explanation for the origin ascribes it to the days of the British Empire in the 19th (and early 20th) century when there was constant steamship travel between England and India. In those pre-air conditioning days, it was unbearably hot crossing the Indian Ocean, and the coolest cabins were the most sought after. That meant, when traveling east, those on the port side; sailing west, those on the starboard. Consequently, those passengers who could afford the luxury booked “Port Outward/Starboard Homeward” or “P.O.S.H.” The acronym thus became a synonym for whatever is first-class or luxurious. A more likely definition is that it is a word from Romany, the language of Gypsies, meaning half. The word originally entered England’s underworld in the 17th century in such compounds as posh-houri, meaning half-pence, and soon became a slang term for money in general. And then the meaning changed to expensive or fancy.”News” has no nautical origin that we know of. It’s the plural of “new” and is from the old French word for new — noveles. Its original meaning was “new things, novelties,” and eventually came to encompass “tidings, or an account of recent events and occurrences brought as new information.” Now we use it in the singular form, but until this century the plural form was used.”", "label": "Formatting, Style, and Errors", "split": false}

{"line": "Within the scientific community, fear of projections like this one have sometimes crippled our understanding of shared animal experience. Anthropomorphism, or the attribution of “human” characteristics to nonhuman animals or objects, has been something of a dirty word in the behavioral sciences. Such fears have long informed studies such as one I once worked on in southeast Alaska. We were observing grizzly bears and their interactions with human fishermen along a salmon stream in Katmai National Park. The same bears came back summer after summer to fish, bicker, and raise their cubs and were easily recognizable by their scars, fishing styles, and personalities. And yet, as researchers, we were instructed only to use numbers to refer to the bears lest our use of human names for them might cause us to attribute human desires and thoughts to the bears as well. But outside of our official survey forms and notes, we all used names for them, like “Diver” for a bear who was fond of diving to the bottom of the river to catch his salmon. As far as I know, calling him Diver did not encourage us to assume that he was engaged in anything but bearish behavior—but that was the concern.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "The importance of metals to the technology of human civilization means that there has been considerable “selective erosion” of them by mining, to bring them from subsurface (often deep subsurface) levels to the surface. Although much of the metals have been processed into artifacts of different kinds, the overspill from the mining, smelting, and production processes have spread metal-rich plumes into waters, soils and near-shore marine sediments. Working out the precise scale of these local metal anomalies is not straightforward, as pre-disturbance background levels need first to be evaluated, but clear enrichments in the environmental levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, and other metals have been widely recognized in industrialized regions (Gałuszka, Migaszewski, & Zalasiewicz, 2014). More widely, aerosols (particularly of lead, from smelting and formerly from lead additives in fuel) have changed the composition of peat bogs, glaciers and icecaps, and these changes may readily be detected. Indeed, various sources of lead have been discriminated in these stratigraphic archives by means of lead isotope ratios, and these patterns are significant to defining and recognizing the Anthropocene.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

I have said that the banker buys a credit; I add that, on his side, the borrower buys a present sum for a sum not due. In all cases, the borrower who sells his credit does not contract the obligation of returning the same thing, characteristic of the loan; his obligation is, to deliver the chose and guarantee its payment. On the other hand, the banker becomes proprietor of the effect, with the same title as if he had bought any other article; he uses it as be pleases, and has nothing more to do with the one who assigned it to him except so far as pertains to the security.\"", "label": "clean", "split": false}

There are at least four major options (with many variations and less likely alternatives): (1) Some prefer to leave the text as it is, reading “Shiloh” and understanding it as the place where the ark rested for a while in the time of the Judges. (2) By repointing the text others arrive at the translation “until the [or “his”] ruler comes,” a reference to a Davidic ruler or the Messiah. (3) Another possibility that does not require emendation of the consonantal text, but only repointing, is “until tribute is brought to him” (so NEB, JPS, NRSV), which has the advantage of providing good parallelism with the following line, “the nations will obey him.” (4) The interpretation followed in the present translation, “to whom it [belongs]” (so RSV, NIV, REB), is based on the ancient versions.

{"line": "Something happened in one of the East African economies a few years back which might be a key learning point for the rest of the East Africa, Rwanda included. The Kenyan shilling was declared the worst performing currency (as of October 2011) with the nose dive it took particularly when paired against the US dollar. The shilling dangerously lingered above the KES 100/dollar mark when the average rate two months prior was KES 80/dollar. The Central Bank of Kenya was then taken to task to stabilize the shilling. In response, it engaged mainly in Repos i.e. repurchase agreements and the other traditional monetary policy intervening tools to ensure the rate of exchange was improved. Question is, was this effective? Were there other options available? I would want us to have a look at the main market fundamentals that would put any economy in such a precarious condition; well albeit for the majority of the locals except for persons paid in dollar terms. It has to be noted that some of these fundamentals are interrelated to some large extent to those touching on inflation. As a quick reminder, in a floating exchange rate regime, the forces of demand and supply dictate the rate of exchange. What it means is that the more your currency is demanded, the more value it gets. Here then comes the thinking; that we need to ensure East African currencies have a sustained demand when paired against the hard currencies of the world. World over, the US dollar is used for most international transactions. An increase in its demand by most East African importers simply means that its value will appreciate against the East African currencies. The root cause hence is the significant increase in imports.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Made of a cheap synthetic — MDF — the chair is nonetheless very elegant with its linseed oil and pine-resin finish. In between the two chairs, Alfred has installed a wide assortment of classics from the annals of modernism, including pieces by Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Charles Eames and a raft of others.

During the vegetative phase, leaves appear and grow, which define the crop leaf area (LAI) that intercepts solar radiation and ultimately affects canopy photosynthesis and crop growth. During the reproductive phase, the potential number and size of kernels is defined at silking and grain filling takes place until physiological maturity, when final crop yield is defined. Two weeks before and after silking is a critical period in maize, so that any stress (biotic and abiotic) during this period affects yield drastically (Ritchie et al., 1997; Bergamaschi and Matzenauer, 2009).", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Transactions of the ASABE. 50(2):667-674. Interpretive Summary: Vegetation indices calculated from remote sensing imagery are commonly used to estimate crop plant growth and yield, but most of these indices use only two spectral bands in the image. This study evaluated linear spectral unmixing techniques, which can use all the bands in the image, for estimating yield variability from airborne multispectral imagery. Linear spectral unmixing models were applied to five time-sequential airborne images collected from a grain sorghum field to generate crop plant and soil abundance images. Plant and soil abundance data were significantly related to grain yield with equivalent or better correlations compared with the normalized difference vegetation index. These results indicate that linear spectral unmixing techniques can be used alone or in conjunction with traditional vegetation indices for quantifying crop canopy cover and mapping crop yield.", "label": "Bibliographical and Citation References", "split": false}

Combined with EFT and NLP it will give you desired results and a powerful, personal transformation.

You can compare life coaching to working with a personal coach. The coach can design your work out and meal plans so you can get the desired results (e.g. losing weight, build muscles etc) but in the end you have to follow the plan in order to get the result. If you choose to not work out and eat what you've always eaten you would probably also not be surprised that nothing changed.

He was the first great prophet who appeared after centuries of the absence of prophets. Many considered him as the Messiah. When in the year 50, Paul passed through Ephesus, in Asia Minor, he found a group of persons who had been baptized with the baptism of John (cf. Acts 19, 1-4).

{"line": "Turning to the US presidential race. Robin Morgan has a column at Women's Media Center. Violet Socks (Reclusive Leftist) has a response. You can also see Marcia's \"\" and \".\" I'll address in part tonight in \"I Hate The War.\" Robin's column is a very bad column. It will be addressed in part tonight because Jim's asked me to save a topic (as Kat noted Monday) for Third this weekend. After that goes up, Robin's column will appear even more uninformed. For now, you can read Marcia's \"When feminist 'leaders' lie\" and \"Ralph Nader, HB Melissa, and more\" Robin is a strong voice and real feminist leader (not a 'leader') so it's a damn shame she chose to publish that column. Again, we'll address tonight. For now, she's elected to play a round of \"Bash the Bitch.\" It's not pretty. It is embarrassing and it is deeply harmful to feminism. And let's be really clear, no one would mistake Robin's column for a \"catfight.\" It is \"Bash the Bitch.\" Which is worse? \"Bash the Bitch\" is how you get women burned at the stake in earlier times. Today, you burn them with lies, half-truths and a double standard. My opinion, \"Bash the Bitch\" is much worse than a \"catfight.\" Robin should have known better. Violet Socks also points out that while Governor Palin proudly defines herself as a feminist, Michelle Obama replied when asked that question, \"You know, I'm not that into labels. So probably, if you laid out a feminist agenda, I would probably agree with a large portion of it. I wouldn't identify as a feminist just like I probably wouldn't identify as a liberal or a progressive.\" Well of course she wouldn't. Sexism is the theme of the Obama household. Many a foolish woman has said \"well he has two daughters!\" That has to be the most insane and ahistorical remark made yet. Are we supposed to believe that women just emerged in the last few decades? Men have always had daughters and sons. And sexism has always thrived. Get a grip. Your first clue was his insistence upon going along with Michelle to a job interview (Michelle's job interview). That tells you his actual opinion of women -- their abilities and their intellect. It would appear Robin's been bitten by the Sour Grape Girl syndrome. Hopefully, it's a 24-hour viral sort of illness. Semi-related, garychappelhill (The Confluence) has a post. It has nothing to do with this topic but a comment garychappelhill left on Riverdaughter's post resulted in a number of e-mails here. While the sour grape girls can't bring themselves to call out homophobia, a lot of people are suffering. Gary is a gay man and wrote of the damage done to the LGBT community in Barack's campaign. That topic will be brought up tonight but I probably won't have time to link to him and will probably focus more on lesbians than gay males so we're including a link to his post. A number of community members e-mailed afraid that he would stop writing. He's already written a post today. That's an understandable fear. Team Obama has run an ugly, disgusting campaign and the 'progressives' have refused to call it out thereby sending the message to so many people that they are unwanted. PUMA is only one response to the ugly campaign. There are a number of people who've been made to feel they do not fit in with the 'grand vision.' Sadly, Robin's very bad column will only further that impression.", "label": "Offensive or Inappropriate Content", "split": false}

The FT’s Robin Harding points out that “several” in the Fed minutes means 4-5, while “a few” means 2-3, which suggests that the committee is roughly evenly split, so it is a stretch to interpret the minutes as hawkish. More significantly, as Bernanke explained at his latest press conference, the purpose of asset purchases is to increase the “near-term momentum” of the economy; if “several” members expect near-term momentum to pick up well before the end of 2013 then it would be entirely coherent for them to expect asset purchases to end on the same time frame. If momentum does not pick up, there is no reason to suppose that the “several” members would not support continued purchases.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

On their first night there, he takes fright and returns home. Left alone, she turns to prostitution, and years later, when the boy is now in Seoul in film school, she agrees to participate in a student film he’s crewing. He doesn’t recognize her. More years pass, and the boy is now a film director. He returns to the village, recalls their runaway romance, and in despair attempts suicide.

The wrong answer would be: “We had to import some food products!” East Africa should have the capacity to be self-sufficient in terms of food production. Any trading in food items should be within the countries in the East Africa Community. This will potentially reduce the demand for the hard currencies and spur local production. Continued importation of goods that can be locally produced, trickles down to the level of inflation we feel as a country once the imported goods are marked up and sold to final consumers. We do of course envision a time when the East African Community would be a full Union that would have a common currency and hence streamline the intra trade.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

All figure-of-eight mics are prone to popping at close quarters, and they also exhibit the proximity effect, which further boosts the bass end when used at very close range, so a pop shield is essential for vocal work. Despite the need to EQ, I really liked what the Sigma did for acoustic guitar.

Currently, almost all existing works focus on constructing minimum-sized CDS under the deterministic network model. However, because of the existence of many probabilistic lossy links in WSNs, it is more practical to obtain a VB under the realistic probabilistic network model (PNM). Moreover, load-balance factor cannot be neglected when constructing a VB to prolong network lifetime. Hence, in this paper, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm to construct a load-balanced VB under PNM. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed methods extend network lifetime by 69% on average compared with the existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "label": "Technical Specifications and Metadata", "split": false}

If modernists talk about semiotics at all, they usually refer to the structuralist caricature of it, as it has been put forward by de Saussure, establishing a closed version of the sign as a “triangle”. Peircean signs—and these have been used by Venturi—establish as an interpretive situation. They do not refer to objects, but just to other signs. Their reference to the world is provided through instances of abstract models and a process of symbolification, which includes learning as an ability that precedes knowledge. (more detail here in this earlier essay) Unfortunately, Venturi’s concept have scarcely been updated, except perhaps in the context of media facades .

The laws of Solon, made for an essentially commercial people, placed no restriction or limit on the employment of money. At Rome, the severity of the legislation on this subject only provoked disobedience. Capital, which was persecuted, became exacting in proportion to the risks to which it was exposed. Nowhere was theory more strangely in contradiction with practice.

I watched folks like Frank Schleck crash out of the tour, and heard about all those guys with injuries like tendinitis that prevented them from even starting the tour. And that got me thinking about Katie Compton and her strange leg cramps, and now her thyroid issues. And I thought: Well, it's not like I couldn't race the Tour or Cyclocross World Championships when I could have won them. It's my first year as a PRO, and I've done pretty well, but another year of training will help me a ton, and the knowledge I've gained this year about how to prevent injury, how to train more efficiently, and how to take better care of my body will prove invaluable. So my new goal became to get back on my bike in time to ride Moscow Mt. before I had to leave and to be ready to put in some fairly long hours on the bike when I got to Granby and Nationals.

Yes, you do (as she points out) need to focus on your users and do things that they'll find useful, but for a lot of the time they don't *know* about this new stuff, and surely it's the responsibility of a library and librarians to say 'I can show you how to do this better and more effectively, in ways you've maybe never thought of' rather than to just sit back and let them decide.

On August 13, the Mets hosted the three-time defending NL East champion Phillies at Citi Field, with Dickey squaring off against Cole Hamels. Both pitchers brought their A-games to the mound, putting zero after zero on the scoreboard through five innings. But in addition to the zeroes under the \"R\" column for both teams, the Phillies also had a zero under the \"H\" as well, as Dickey had held Philadelphia hitless through five. The 35,440 fans in attendance were all aware that no Met had ever tossed a no-hitter as Dickey and the Mets entered the sixth, an inning that would begin with Dickey striking out the light-hitting Wilson Valdez. But a soft single by Dickey's mound opponent, Cole Hamels, ended his quest for baseball immortality. Hamels' hit would be the only one produced by the Phillies all game, as Dickey went on to pitch a complete game won by the Mets, 1-0, on a sixth-inning, RBI double by Carlos Beltran. It was the first complete game and first shutout for Dickey since August 20, 2003.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "Although the genetic defects are well known and characterized, the pathogenic mechanism remains elusive, and treatment of the disease remains mainly supportive, with poor efficacy. For an evidence-based therapy, it is crucial to determine the exact pathogenic mechanisms occurring in the disease. Animals or cell-based models are thus necessary; in the past a mouse model of MVK deficiency was generated  however it was unable to correctly represent the pathology. Then a cellular model have been developed, where the mevalonate pathway is pharmacologically targeted using HMG-CoA blockers (statins), mimicking some of the inflammatory features observed in cells from patients . Using this strategy, our group and other authors have found that, in different cell lines, NALP3 inflammasome activation is responsible for initiating inflammation [4-6]. This multi-molecular complex, constituted by NALP3, ASC and Caspase-1, cleaves pro-IL-1β to release its active form, starting inflammation . Accordingly, NALP3 activation could represent a possible starting point for MA pathogenic progression. A number of issues need to be clarified, such as how the inflammasome pathway is incorrectly activated in cells presenting the pathological mutations. In the attempt to better mimic MA pathology we developed a novel murine cell model in which MVK expression is specifically down-regulated, using the silencing RNA (siRNA) technology. We then compared the results obtained by siRNA transfection with those achieved with Lovastatin and LPS treatment, in order to determine the better model suitable for mimicking the pathologic condition.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "To inject interferon beta-1a, follow these steps: Remove the prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow it to warm to room temperature for about 30 minutes before using. Do not use a heat source such as hot water or a microwave to warm the syringe.Check the syringe to be sure it is safe to use. The syringe should be labeled with the correct name of the medication and an expiration date that has not passed and should contain a clear to slightly yellow solution. If the syringe is expired, or the solution is cloudy, discolored, or contains particles, do not use it and call your pharmacist.Set up a clean, well-lit, flat work surface, like a table, to collect all the supplies you will need to inject interferon beta-1a. Assemble these supplies: alcohol wipes, gauze pad, small adhesive bandage, and puncture-resistant container for disposal of used syringes and needles.Wash your hands well with antibacterial soap.Choose a spot to inject interferon beta-1a and clean it with an alcohol wipe, using a circular motion. Let the skin air dry.Remove the cap from the syringe needle.The syringe should be filled with interferon beta-1a to the 0.5-mL mark. This is a full dose. If your doctor has told you to use less than the full dose, slowly push the syringe plunger in until the amount of medication left in the syringe is the amount your doctor told you to use.Use your thumb and forefinger to pinch up a pad of skin around the spot where you will inject interferon beta-1a. Hold the syringe like a pencil with your other hand.Hold the syringe at a 90-degree angle (straight up and down), and push the needle straight into your skin, stopping just underneath the skin.When the needle is in, let go of the pinched skin and slowly push down on the syringe plunger until the syringe is empty.Hold a gauze pad near the needle and pull the needle straight out of the skin. Use the gauze pad to apply pressure to the spot for a few seconds. You may cover the spot with a bandage.Throw away the used syringe, needle, and gauze pad properly.Apply a cold compress or ice pack to the injection spot to help reduce redness, swelling, or tenderness that may occur.After 2 hours, check the injection spot for redness, swelling, or tenderness. If you have redness, swelling, or tenderness that does not go away in a few days or is severe, call your doctor.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Of them, the “early Anthropocene” is historically highly significant—but the processes, and stratigraphic signals, were diachronous, taking millennia to spread across those parts of the globe they affected (Edgeworth et al., 2015). The same, in a more compressed form, may be said about the Industrial Revolution. It is the mid-20th century “Great Acceleration” that represents the most widespread and synchronous or near-synchronous signals, and also the greatest changes (so far) to the Earth system, and it is likely therefore that a level some time in the mid-20th century will become accepted as the beginning of the Anthropocene (Zalasiewicz et al., 2015), whether this new time term is formalized or not.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "URUGUAY (officially the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay, and long locally called the Banda Oriental, meaning the land on the eastern side of the river Uruguay, from which the country takes its name), the smallest independent state in South America. It runs conterminous with the southern border of Brazil, and lies between 30° and 35° S. and between 53° 25 and 57° 42/ W. (for map, see ARGENTINA). It has a seaboard on the Atlantic Ocean of 120 m., a shore-line to the south on the Rio de la Plata of 235 m., and one of 270 In. along the Uruguay on the west. The boundaries separating it from Rio Grande do Sul, a province of Brazil, are Lake Mirim, the rivers Chuy, Jaguarao and Quarahy, and a cuchilla or low range of hills called Santa Ana. The extent of the northern frontier is 450 m. The southern half of the country is mostly undulating grass land, well watered by streams and springs. The northern section is more broken and rugged; barren ridges and low rocky mountain-ranges, interspersed with fertile valleys, being its characteristic features. There is no forest, timber of any size being found only in the valleys near running water. Uruguay is intersected nearly from west to north-east by the river Negro and its affluent the Yi. The Uruguay is navigable all the year by steamers from the island of Martin Garcia at the mouth to Saito (200 m.). Above this place the navigation is interrupted by rapids. The ordinary volume of water in the Uruguay averages II millions of cub. ft. per minute. Excluding the Uruguay, the Negro, of which the principal port is Mercedes, is the principal navigable river. Others are navigable only for short distances by Steamers of light draught. Besides the rivers mentioned, the chief streams are the Santa Lucia, which falls into the Plata a little west of Montevideo; the Queguay, in Paysandu; and the Cebollati, rising in the sierras in Minas and flowing into Lake Mirim. These rivers as well as the Uruguay are fed by innumerable smaller streams or arroyos, such as the Arapey in Salto, the Dayman in Paysandu, the Iaguary (an affluent of the Negro) -in Tacuarembo, the Arroyo Grande between the departments of Soriano and San Iosé, and the San José (an affluent of the Santa Lucia). None of the sierras or mountains in Uruguay exceeds (or perhaps even attains) a height of 2000 ft.; but, contrasting in their tawny colour with the grassy undulating plains, they loom high and are often picturesque. T hey are ramifications of the highlands of Brazil. The main chains are the Cuchilla de Haedo on the north and west and the Cuchilla Grande on the south and east. Geology.-Little is known of the geology of Uruguay. There is a foundation of schists and crystalline rocks upon which rests a series of sandstones. The latter is, no doubt, identical with the similar sandstone series which is found in the neighbouring Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul, and which has there yielded plants which prove it to belong to the Permian or the upper part of the Carboniferous. The plains are covered by a formation similar to that of the Argentine pampas and by the alluvial deposits of the present rivers.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

Adeniums are appreciated for their colorful flowers, but also for their unusual, thick caudices. They can be grown for many years in a pot and are commonly used for bonsai.Because seed-grown plants are not genetically identical to the mother plant, desirable varieties are commonly propagated by grafting. Genetically identical plants can also be propagated by cutting. However, cutting-grown plants do not tend to develop a desirable thick caudex as quickly as seed-grown plants. Kalachuchi is a small, deciduous tree, 3 to 7 meters high with a crooked trunk, smooth and shining stems, succulent, with abundant sticky, milky latex. Bark has a smooth, papery outer layer which is gray, and constantly exfoliating in small flakes. Wood is yellowish-white and soft. Branches are thick, fleshy swollen and leafy at the tips. Leaves are crowded at the terminal end of the branch, commonly oblong in shape 20 to 40 centimeters long, 7 centimeters wide spirally arranged at the ends of the branches.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "Under the current climate scenario, maize crop emerged from 15/03 to 15/06 was killed by frost before reaching PM in all 99 growing seasons (Table 1). These simulation results are realistic, as these emergence dates are out of the currently recommended sowing dates for maize in this subtropical location. For the maize emerged on 15/02 and 15/07, plants were killed in 91 and 94 out of the 99 growing seasons, respectively. For the other six emergence dates under current climate, maize was less killed by frost and not killed at all for the 15/11 to 15/12 emergence dates (Table 1), which is realistic for this location. As temperature increased in the elevated temperature scenarios, the number of years in which crop was killed by frost decreased for all emergence dates mainly in the scenarios with asymmetric increase in daily temperature (Table 1). These results indicate that if global warming will confirm, the growing season for maize in this location will be longer by the end of this century, i.e. anticipated in the Winter and extended into late Summer. A lengthening in the calendar for growing crops in subtropical and temperature regions may lead to significant changes in field management practices, such as pests and diseases occurrence and rotation schedules. These changes may be beneficial on one hand, allowing more than one maize cropping per year but of concern on the other hand, as many insects and pathogens may survive during winter time, increasing risks and costs with sprayings, which is also further not environmentally friendly.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

On the one hand, some users are saying 'we want video games in the library' and so some librarians are giving them games. Other librarians say 'this is nonsense! This is a library for gods sake, and we have books!' We need to walk a tightrope, and quite frankly I'm a bit sick of the brigade who say 'we need to just do what our users tell us'. I'm sorry, but I didn't spend 4 years in library school learning about this to be told by an 18 year old that he or she knows what is best. Call me elitist if you like, I don't care. Sometimes information professionals DO know best. (The clue is in the word 'professional' by the way). We've had the whole 'Google generation' thing where we've actually found out that the teenagers don't always know search better than the rest of us, which shouldn't come as a surprise but oddly has. Teenagers and other users are saying that they don't want the library in their Facebook etc. Well, if they don't want the library there, don't become a fan, don't use the resource, don't subscribe to the group. If you don't want a real life library - just don't come into it! It's not exactly rocket science is it? And yet... and yet.. some librarians are saying 'Oh, they know best. They're the patrons. They're the Google generation. They're younger and more tech savvy than we are. We'd better go back to the books.' No, no, no, no NO! We need to be providing services of all sorts, we need to be involved in outreach, we need to get out there and offer this stuff. Some of them will ignore it, and that's absolutely fine and their right. Others will use it, and that's fine as well. But if we don't DO that, if we just sit in the walls of our libraries, to be honest we may just as well pack up and go home.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

They make the case that the best time to address this spiritual poverty and hunger is during the college years, and that the most effective way to fill these perceived yearnings is through spiritual development. It must be noted that the authors do not equate spirituality with religion. This book presupposes that religion is only valuable inasmuch as it facilitates spirituality, which according to the authors’ definition, does not require God (137). Their interest is not in producing religious persons or Christians of any kind, but rather cultivating college students and graduates who are successful, psychologically healthy, and altruistic. It is of no consequence to the authors if those students are Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, areligious, or atheistic.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

From poultry to fish, beef to bacon and everything in between the multi-billion dollar company has negotiated the acquisition of major food suppliers such as Tyson and Baho Foods. The expansion into Asia-Pacific regions, Australia, and South American countries in addition to many more, was a smart move for OSI, but two of the major contributors are Europe and China.

{"line": "Once again, you have managed to write a very interesting and captivating chapter. I like the way you give the events on the North Tower from Malfoy's perspective, it does give some interesting insight into his personality as you have written him. However, thre are a couple of spots where Malfoy has a pretty good sized chunk of dialogue which ends with a line of dialogue by Hermione. It might be a little less confusing if you give Hermione's dialogue it's own paragraph, even if that means the paragraph is only one sentence long. For example, you can split this paragraph (which needs quotation marks at the beginning), ‘Then, I was actually there, with Dumbledore, and he was not quite right. He was weak but he was talking, talking too much. He wasn’t afraid of me. He wasn’t afraid in the least. Then he told me that I wasn’t a killer. I was so stupid; I was actually insulted even though I knew it was true. I knew, right at that moment, that I couldn’t do what they expected me to do. I was going to fail. I tried to fight it. I didn’t want to die because I couldn’t do it. Dumbledore offered me help, but how could I take it when I knew I was going to die for not killing the man who was trying to help me?! Then the rest of them showed up, and they taunted me to try to get me to do it. My hands were shaking so bad I couldn’t even aim my wand. Dumbledore actually smiled at me once or twice. Then Snape came in and he did it. Then, Dumbledore just fell over the side of the tower.” He stopped speaking and blinked his eyes several times. The tears had not fallen, though they still glimmered in the corners of his eyes. Hermione felt her own eyes welling up as she looked at him. She breathed heavily and blinked them away. “What happened after you left Hogwarts? Why are you here?”' I would split it right when you start talking about Hermione feeling tears in her eyes. As you're shifting the focus from Draco to Hermione, you can split the paragraph without really doing anything to flow of the overall story. Anyway, that's just a suggestion. Your writing is great and I can't wait for the next chapter to be posted. Happy writing!", "label": "clean", "split": false}

{"line": "The beginning of this decade saw the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which began in 2012 in response to the shooting of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. It has since evolved into an international protest movement denouncing systemic racism and police brutality. Police shootings, especially those leading to the deaths of Philando Castille and Alton Sterling in the summer of 2016, reignited the modern athlete-activism movement, which had been largely dormant since the turn of the century. Yet observers of police violence have argued that attention to these killings has waned since Donald Trump became president in 2016. Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery was arrested in 2014 while reporting in Ferguson, Missouri, after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed in a police shooting, and has since become a watchdog on policing nationally. “Police violence—beatings, Taserings, killings—and criminal justice reform more broadly were arguably the leading domestic news story line during the final two years of the Obama administration,” he wrote last year. “The deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, and others dominated headlines, inspired nationwide protests and brought on a pro-law-enforcement backlash that helped elect President Trump. Now the issue has all but vanished from the national political conversation.”", "label": "clean", "split": false}

The goal of this work is to develop a better understanding of the factors that govern the stability and structural preferences of these compounds through a combination of experimental and theoretical tools. Specifically, the main questions being addressed are: (1) What is the O---Sn (Ge/C) distance trend in related sequences of 5-, 6-, and 7-coordinate systems? (2) How does the strength of the O---Sn (Ge/C) interaction change as a function of halogen content and electronegativity? and (3) How do the structural and spectroscopic properties of the Sn and Ge complexes compare with those of the trityl acetylenes? On a regular basis, Dr. Stoudt's research group consists of 2-3 undergraduate students.

Quite simply, most western interventions over the past few decades have served only to enrich the arms industry, satisfy our desire ‘to do something’, and provide news channels with exciting footage. And to what end? Can we influence the course of a civil war? A more compassionate approach would be to accept that terrible things can happen, and that we have absolutely no control or influence over them. In such scenarios, the best course of action is to adopt the first principle of medicine. That is: ‘First, do no harm’. And that may mean doing nothing at all.", "label": "clean", "split": false}

But since the remainder of the training can be accessed online, this option may be a more practical solution to finding the free time to attend classes for some students. Pertaining to tuition, a number of online CNA programs are less expensive than other on campus choices. Even supplementary expenses such as for commuting and study materials can be reduced, helping to make education more economical. And numerous online programs are accredited by organizations such as the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).

{"line": "Taya Graham: This is Taya Graham, reporting for the Real News Network in Baltimore City, Maryland. I’m standing outside the Maryland State Prosecutor’s Office, the agency that nearly two years ago launched a criminal probe into the life of Kelvin D. Sewell, Pocomoke City’s first black police chief. But, with an appeal pending before the state’s highest court, key groups are stepping up to raise questions about what went on inside this building. Since the trial of then-Chief Kelvin Sewell for failing to charge a driver who hit two parked cars in Pocomoke in 2014, there have been doubts about the case among his supporters. Stephen Janis: You saw the evidence. You think the evidence added up to corruption? Rev. James Jones: No. No, not by any means. Not by any means. Not even over-exercising his authority. They tried to say that they could not do anything with the corruption, but they felt that he exercised his authority too strongly, but he didn’t. Taya Graham: Concerns that the investigation was retaliation for Sewell following EEOC complaints against a variety of Worcester County officials, alleging discrimination after he was fired without explanation in 2015. Sewell was convicted of one count of misconduct for failing to charge the driver who hit cars with leaving the scene of an accident. The driver had driven his car two blocks after the collision to his home where he called police. When we asked Maryland State Prosecutor, Emmet Davitt, about the source of his charges, he said Sewell’s replacement had tipped him off about the accident. Stephen Janis: You were going to tell us about when this case was initiated during the trial? Emmet Davitt: Yeah, sure, and I can certainly direct you now. It’s a matter of public record. There’s all kinds of motions where the whole investigation is laid out if you go to the court files, so I’m not trying to blow off your question, but basically, it was initiated when Chief Kelvin Sewell called our office making complaints about others. Things didn’t seem to add up. He then left the department. The new interim chief came. There was a series of complaints. We were called, repeatedly, asking us to get involved in the investigation. We came down and became involved. Stephen Janis: Was that Beau Oglesby who asked you, or was it anybody … Emmet Davitt: No that was the interim Police Chief that took over. Taya Graham: But documents obtained by the Real News revealed the person who actually gave Davitt the case was Worcester County States Attorney, Beau Oglesby. The subject of Sewell’s EEOC discrimination complaint. Which is, perhaps, why several groups including Howard university Civil Rights Law Clinic, the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers and the ACLU have filed amicus briefs supporting Sewell’s appeals before a hearing in December. The brief describes how emails obtained from Davitt show the investigators launched a wide range of investigation of Sewell after he was fired, including allegations that he traded liquor for favors, and tried to seduce a 75 year old grandmother. Davitt said in court that he had no contact with Oglesby during the investigation, but it was in fact Oglesby who gave Davitt the case. In this email, which the Worcester County States Attorney actually sent the documents outlining his theory to Davitt’s office. But the brief also reveals the unprecedented nature of Davitt’s decision to pursue Sewell. Records obtained by the ACLU revealed that Oglesby had never investigated a police officer for discretion. In fact, Davitt also never pursued an officer after retirement. Debbie Jeon: It is really unusual, as far as we can determine, for the State Prosecutor to charge police officers with police misconduct. That’s the first thing. But it also is our understanding that this prosecution originated with the defendants in our civil rights case. Taya Graham: We asked Davitt for comment, and he said to us that Sewell’s lieutenant Lionel Green told investigators that they had let the driver go because he was a Mason. However, lieutenant Green denies Davitt’s version of events. For now, Sewell awaits his day in court, his future uncertain.

It also supported the 1934 National Firearms Act—the first major federal gun-control legislation—and the 1938 Federal Firearms Act, which together created a licensing system for dealers and prohibitively taxed the private ownership of automatic weapons (“machine guns”). ...
