{"text": "The cases that the Court relies upon for the proposition that there is no distinction between temporary and permanent takings, see ante, at 318, are inapposite, for they all deal with physical takings - where the diminution of value test is inapplicable. 8 None of those cases is controversial; the state [482 U.S. 304, 332] certainly may not occupy an individual's home for a month and then escape compensation by leaving and declaring the occupation \"temporary.\" But what does that have to do with the proper inquiry for regulatory takings? Why should there be a constitutional distinction between a permanent restriction that only reduces the economic value of the property by a fraction - perhaps one-third - and a restriction that merely postpones the development of a property for a fraction of its useful life - presumably far less than a third? In the former instance, no taking has occurred; in the latter case, the Court now proclaims that compensation for a taking must be provided. The Court makes no effort to explain these irreconcilable results. Instead, without any attempt to fit its proclamation into our regulatory takings cases, the Court boldly announces that once a property owner makes out a claim that a regulation would constitute a taking if allowed to stand, then he or she is entitled to damages for the period of time between its enactment and its invalidation.", "label": "clean"}

Even though I’ve got young kids myself, and have developed a fairly shrewd idea as to what I think would enthuse and excite them (it’s not rocket-science, it usually involves a dynamic, clear, and boldly imaginative kind of storytelling), I can get caught out. Sometimes children will appear bored during shows they emerge raving about - sometimes they seem enthralled only to reveal themselves later as wholly bemused. I had a big hunch watching Treasure Island the other night at the Theatre Royal Haymarket that my seven-year-old son would respond in delight to its rambunctious spirit; in this my four-star verdict diverged sharply from that of critics on other papers who, one notes, don’t have kids in the targeted age-range.”", "label": "clean"}

Historian Nicholas Rogers, exploring the origins of Halloween, notes that while \"some folklorists have detected its origins in the Roman feast of Pomona, the goddess of fruits and seeds, or in the festival of the dead called Parentalia, it is more typically linked to the Celtic festival of Samhain\", which comes from the Old Irish for \"summer's end\". Samhain (pronounced SAH-win or SOW-in) was the first and most important of the four quarter days in the medieval Gaelic (Irish, Scottish and Manx) calendar. It was held on or about October 31 – November 1 and kindred festivals were held at the same time of year in other Celtic lands; for example the Brythonic Calan Gaeaf (in Wales), Kalan Gwav (in Cornwall) and Kalan Goañv (in Brittany). Samhain is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and many important events in Irish mythology happen or begin on Samhain. It marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the 'darker half' of the year. This was a time for stock-taking and preparing for the cold winter ahead; cattle were brought back down from the summer pastures and livestock were slaughtered. In much of the Gaelic world, bonfires were lit and there were rituals involving them. Some of these rituals hint that they may once have involved human sacrifice. Divination games or rituals were also done at Samhain.", "label": "clean"}

The same cannot be said for informing evangelical Christianity, and its youth in particular, about the more insidious pseudoscience of psychotherapy. Too few are addressing this travesty while two very influential evangelical organizations, Focus on the Family and the American Association of Christian Counselors, lead the way in attempting to integrate the Bible and psychology. Tragically, this major seducer of the next generation of evangelicals is an anti-biblical development that has set up shop and is thriving in the evangelical church.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Wherever my travels have taken me this year, whether as close as the screening room down the street or as far afield as the Cannes Film Festival in France, the sentiment has been the same: What a banner year it has been for American movies. And at a time when there isn’t much about our country that everyone the world over can agree on, these words of praise have been spoken by critics, filmmakers and just plain moviegoers of myriad tongues and nationalities. Far be it from me to argue: Of the 17 titles I’ve managed to shoehorn into the 10 slots below (with an eye toward potential double and triple features), all but four are American or American co-productions. Even more notable than this surfeit may be the fact that some of the most venturesome work in this annus mirabilis for homegrown cinema came in movies produced and/or released by the major Hollywood studios or their subsidiary “specialty” divisions. Not that the news was always good: Two of those films, Zodiac and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, were expensive commercial failures, while the box-office fate of the riskiest venture of them all, Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood, remains to be seen. All of which makes one wonder how willing, with its purse strings already tightened by an ongoing writers strike, Hollywood will be to take such risks in the future.", "label": "clean"}

In addition, newspapers regularly report on federal prosecutions, and their accounts can easily be found on the Internet.

{"text": "TSA Screeners have a thankless job~The job the screeners do is extremely difficult with the limited tools they are provided...under often thankless conditions.Consider this;A. in the majority of airports the most 'private' space a screener can take a break, is usually a coffee shopB. often, when a supervisor needs to have a briefing with their team, they do it in a very public settingC. Being a screener is like being 'on stage' 8-10 hours per day...with every mis-step or frown being noticed D. Screeners are not empowered to effect change - how many times have you questioned a policy and gotten a 'good' answer? In LAS VEGAS, screeners are not required to yell over and over again for passengers to remove their electronics etc. In places like LAX where the screening checkpoints are bottlenecks, the pressure on screeners to move the line along means that they often don't actually stop the belt and examine every bag, as was once the mandatory practice (which was my experience in Austin, TX yesterday as well). * Note - an experienced x-ray operator can easily distinguish when a tub has nothing but a jacket and belt in it (for example), and having to stop the belt in that case is actually silly and somewhat of an insult to their experience and skill level; HOWEVER, when there are briefcases or electronics involved, it is alarming not to see the belt stopped. No one wants their bags checked...wants to take off their shoes and walk on dirty floors...to be treated like a security risk etc...yet these are the realities of the screening experience today. Maybe next time when traveling through the airport, we should all stop and ask ourselves, \"is it the screener making these rules, or Washington?\" Just maybe, we'll realize the screeners are just doing their job as instructed...and a letter to Washington is better than scorn for the screeners.", "label": "clean"}

Both Beam and IPCO submitted documentary exhibits to the district court: Beam's complaint included a copy of the February 20, 1985 mailgram notifying him of his termination; IPCO's memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss included a copy of the January 14, 1985 letter of reprimand from Beam's supervisor to Beam.1 Beam's exhibit poses no problem under Rule 12(b) because the district court is entitled to consider exhibits attached to the complaint as part of the pleadings. See Griswold v. E.F. Hutton & Co., 622 F.Supp. 1397, 1402-03 (N.D.Ill.1985); 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 1357 at 593 (1969). Under a strict interpretation of Rule 12(b), however, the district court may have erred by not expressly rejecting IPCO's exhibit or, in the alternative, converting the motion into a summary judgment motion. None of the facts contained in the letter of reprimand, however, played any part in the district court's decision approving the motion to dismiss. IPCO did not contend, and the district court did not hold, that Beam was fired for the deficiencies described in the letter. The district court's evaluation of the motion to dismiss turned instead on whether IPCO was permitted to fire Beam for his interactions with his counsel. The district court's failure to provide any formal indication that it excluded IPCO's exhibit from consideration does not, under these circumstances, preclude us from reviewing the district court's order as an appeal of a motion to dismiss.2", "label": "clean"}

However, common disease-associated SNPs explain at most approximately 20% of the genetic variance for Crohn's disease. Several factors may account for this unexplained heritability, including rare risk variants not adequately tagged thus far in GWAS. That rare susceptibility variants indeed contribute to variation in multifactorial phenotypes has been demonstrated for colorectal cancer, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, blood pressure, type 1 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and, in the case of Crohn's disease, for NOD2 (refs. 14,15). Here we describe the use of high-throughput resequencing of DNA pools to search for rare coding variants influencing susceptibility to Crohn's disease in 63 GWAS-identified positional candidate genes. We identify low frequency coding variants conferring protection against inflammatory bowel disease in IL23R, but we conclude that rare coding variants in positional candidates do not make a large contribution to inherited predisposition to Crohn's disease.

{"text": "Before moving on to the Urrutia debate, it should be remarked that there were also some very positive signs coming out of the Haarlem tournament, and these plusses should not be altogether overlooked by Team Cuba boosters. Key to victory in China will be the ability of Cuba’s talented but untested pitching staff to hold in check the professional bats displayed by the USA, Japanese and Canadian lineups (all of which will boast top minor leaguers or all-star Japanese League talents). Cuban hitters can not be expected to carry the load if the veteran starting corps of Vera, Palma, Maya, Jonder Martínez and Yulieski González and the bullpen contingent of Norberto González, Yadir Pedroso, Odelín and Lazo fails to keep the club in games into late innings, when most Cuban squads tend to work their magic. Going into Haarlem my own biggest fear concerning this edition of Team Cuba was precisely the pitching—Lazo is not the same closer he was five years ago, Yulieski González has been consistently brilliant at home but not always effective in international outings, Odelín has not been the same pitcher of late he was in Sydney in 2000 or in San Juan during the WBC miracle. Yet the pitching was indeed solid enough in Haarlem, with Cuba’s sub-2.00 team ERA topped only by the stellar American staff. Vera, Maya and Jonder Martínez were all especially sharp, and Lazo at times looked like the true Lazo of old, especially in the closing innings of the clutch semifinal win over surprising Japan. Only two decidedly disastrous outings by Yulieski González (versus the opportunistic Americans and Japanese) fell squarely on the negative side of the ledger. And the hitting, if consistently sub par, was nonetheless of the clutch variety in all games but two. Bell’s crucial blast in the semifinals sealed a vital victory needed to reach the finals; Despaigne’s pinch-hit double in the seventh rescued the opener with the Dutch Antilles; Cuba had its chances to pull out the first match with the Americans (runners on second and third in the ninth, with only one out and Meriño and Urgelles coming to the plate); and if Despaigne had not been badly jammed on a wicked slider from MLB-prospect Kyle Gibson with the bases loaded and one out in the home eighth of the finale, perhaps no one would today be talking of slumps or of failures during the Haarlem Honkbal Week. More times than not baseball is still truly a game of mere inches.", "label": "clean"}

The true understanding is going to require the Spirit/revelation and engagement with the growth process. Ask/Seek/Knock. There are some clues however to begin with. Action in terms of self should be changed to terms of the broader Kingdom. Receiving should be changed into spreading. Analytical pre-process should be changed to trust and observance, investment and experience seed to sickle. One does not have to know how the process works for the process to work, it works regardless as it is supposed to. The faith of our Lord is not the one being depicted here as not knowing how it is going to happen, that is our faith. It is not that He will leave it all up to us to fill in the details or to nature to make this Kingdom happen. His faith is in the \"Kingdom come, Thy Will be done\" principal where if we obey the Will the Will will take us where He wills us to be. The commitment is our's, the details are left to Him.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "The reproducibility of conventional two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis can be improved using differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE), a new emerging technology for proteomic analysis. In DIGE, two pools of proteins are labeled with 1-(5-carboxypentyl)-1'-propylindocarbocyanine halide (Cy3) N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester and 1-(5-carboxypentyl)-1'-methylindodi-carbocyanine halide (Cy5) N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester fluorescent dyes, respectively. The labeled proteins are mixed and separated in the same 2D gel. 2D DIGE was applied to quantify the differences in protein expression between laser capture microdissection-procured esophageal carcinoma cells and normal epithelial cells and to define cancer-specific and normal-specific protein markers. Analysis of the 2D images from protein lysates of approximately 250,000 cancer cells and normal cells identified 1038 protein spots in cancer cell lysates and 1088 protein spots in normal cell lysates. Of the detected proteins, 58 spots were up-regulated by >3-fold and 107 were down-regulated by >3-fold in cancer cells. In addition to previously identified down-regulated protein annexin I, tumor rejection antigen (gp96) was found up-regulated in esophageal squamous cell cancer. Global quantification of protein expression between laser capture-microdissected patient-matched cancer cells and normal cells using 2D DIGE in combination with mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for the molecular characterization of cancer progression and identification of cancer-specific protein markers.", "label": "clean"}

It has subsequently been continued by additional amendments to the original contract up to the present. The over-all objectives of this program were to make detailed observations and measurements of the internal flow in rotating impellers and stationary diffusors to permit the establishment of accurate design procedures for hydraulic machinery, and to serve as a starting point for realistic mathematical analysis of such flows. It is the intention of this report to indicate the scope of the work done under this contract and to describe the facilities built for its experimental end.

{"text": "“Albrecht (1989) estimates that a roughly 30 percent increase in CCN would be necessary to increase the fractional cloudiness or albedo of marine stratocumulus clouds by 4 percent. Albrecht’s idealized stratocumulus cloud, which he argues is typical, has a thickness of 375 m, a drizzle rate of 1 mm per day, and a mean droplet radius of 100 mm, and he assumes that each droplet is formed by the coalescence of 1000 smaller droplets. The rate at which the CCN are depleted by his model is 1000/cm3 per day. Consequently, about 300/cm3 per day (30 percent of 1000) of additional CCN would have to be discharged per day at the base of the cloud to maintain a 4 percent increase in cloudiness. This assumes that the perturbed atmosphere would also remain sufficiently close to saturation in the vicinity of the CCN that additional cloud cover would be formed every time the number of CCN increased.”", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Phoebastria albatrus breeds on Torishima (Japan), and Minami-kojima (Senkaku Islands), that are claimed jointly by Japan, mainland China and Chinese Taipei. Historically there are believed to have been at least nine colonies south of Japan and in the East China Sea (Piatt et al. 2006). Its marine range covers most of the northern Pacific Ocean, but it occurs in highest densities in areas of upwelling along shelf waters of the Pacific Rim, particularly along the coasts of Japan, eastern Russia, the Aleutians and Alaska (Piatt et al. 2006, Suryan et al. 2007). During breeding (December - May) it is found in highest densities around Japan. Satellite tracking has indicated that during the post-breeding period, females spend more time offshore of Japan and Russia, while males and juveniles spend greater time around the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea and off the coast of North America (Suryan et al. 2007). Juveniles have been shown to travel twice the distances per day and spend more time within continental shelf habitat than adult birds (Suryan et al. 2008). The species declined dramatically during the 19th and 20th centuries owing to exploitation for feathers, and was believed extinct in 1949, but was rediscovered in 1951. The current population is estimated, via direct counts and modelling based on productivity data, to be 2,364 individuals, with 1,922 birds on Torishima and 442 birds on Minami-kojima (G.R. Balogh in litt. 2008). In 1954, 25 birds (including at least six pairs) were present on Torishima. Given that there are now c.426 breeding pairs on Torishima (G.R. Balogh in litt. 2008), the species has undergone an enormous increase since its rediscovery and the onset of conservation efforts. In addition, in 2010, one nesting pair was observed on Kure Atoll (Hawaii, USA), but was probably female-female and unsuccessful, and one chick was produced on Midway Atoll (M. Naughton pers. comm. 2011). A tsunami which hit Midway Atoll in March 2011, did not impact on the single pair nesting on Eastern Island (U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2008).", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "A movie that stands on its own without ignoring both its literary origins in the le Carré novel and the 1979 BBC TV mini-series starring Alec Guinness as spymaster George Smiley. Most of the people I know who claim to have not been able to follow this movie properly were those that did not know the story from previous incarnations, and I can see how the final revelation of the mole in British intelligence is perhaps a little bit too oblique – and the final death a bit too convenient-seeming (unless you’re read the book, where it is made clear that the parties in question had a pre-arranged rendezvous). This may be considered a bit of a failing from a story-telling standpoint and the subplot involving Tom hardy’s Ricky Tarr is perhaps made too prominent at the expense of clarity. Additionally one could argue that Oldman is perhaps too beholden at times to Alec Guinness’ TV portrayal but this movie has virtues all its own, especially in its masterly use of flashback. And the 70s atmosphere is brilliantly caught, the final use of a Julio Iglesias recording brilliantly judged in my view. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Let's go back to the electrolyzers. We have conversion efficiencies anywhere from 90% to 95% for electrolysis in the real-world setting. When you start selling these things, the efficiency decreases on site, in context, from 99%. We also know that the theoretical energy level of hydrogen/oxygen gas is around 50,000 BTUs per pound. But Brown's Gas has at least 66,000 BTUs per pound, and the inventor found a way of getting it up to 210,000 BTUs, which is almost at a nuclear level. If just 80% of this energy can be recaptured, it will be a significant improvement over the main problem with all variable-power input systems: energy storage -- solar, wind, tidal etc; of course, tidal is not important to Ontario. The gas storage development is of a very high priority for future developmental work in this area, yet experience suggests that the off-the-shelf liquid petroleum gas technology storage system is adaptable to Brown's Gas. That means we do not have to reinvent the entire problem of storing the gas, because the LPG system applies as is.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Summary. To investigate the changes in community responsiveness during the pre-community-outbreak phase of the H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong, a pooled sample of 999 adults was interviewed in three surveys (S1, S2, S3) from 7 May to 6 June 2009. Over time, fewer people felt confident in staying free from H1N1 infection in the following year (S1, 63·3%; S3, 46%; P<0·001). The level of distress due to H1N1 remained modest throughout the study period. People's confidence in the government's ability to control a large-scale H1N1 outbreak declined slightly at the third survey (S1, 80·5%; S3, 73·8%; P=0·025). Across the three surveys, respondents remained vigilant with frequent adoption of preventive measures (e.g. wearing face masks in public areas when suffering from influenza-like symptoms and frequent hand-washing). The public was generally supportive of the Hong Kong government although misconceptions regarding the disease were common. Provision of evidence-based public-health education is still warranted as the disease outbreak unfolds.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Formerly, the facelift was just a tightening of the skin without any tightening of the deeper layers of the face. This resulted in the face being supported by the tightened skin only. As skin can continue to stretch, the results did not last too long especially in men who have heavier sebaceous skin. In the early 1970′s, a newer facelift operation was developed where the deeper layers of the face called in medical terms, SMAS-Platysma, was tightened in additional to the skin; this lift also had limitations for men because of the incisions. Dr. Jewell uses a newer technique that was developed by Belgian colleagues known as the MACS lift (Minimal Access Cranial Suspension facelift). This innovative approach to facial rejuvenation uses loops of suture to re-suspend facial structures that have sagged downward with aging. It does not require deep-layer dissection of the SMAS lift and has excellent long-term outcomes. Dr. Jewell is very experienced in this technique and has written textbook chapters on this approach. He also conducts teaching courses to train other plastic surgeons on how to do the MACS lift.", "label": "clean"}

We are so much willing to hold others to a standard that we would never hold ourselves to. We can sniff out hypocrisy in others from a mile a way, perhaps that is because we fully expect it. Judgement cannot be avoided in our day to day lives. Most every activity and relationship encountered in a day requires some form of judgement. It is not judgment that is being forbidden here, it is the type of judgement; the most common type - Hypocrisy. One should learn to expect it from themselves and know how to look for it. We want to be judged a fair judge, one whose judgement applied first and foremost to their own-selves. Judge as one who knew his on weaknesses yet was brave enough to battle his weaknesses and to help others through theirs as well. What use is it to strive not to judge at all, neither owns-self nor others? The Lord's faith is not that we will become a bunch of passivists, it is that we will be able to judge right from wrong, truth from falsehood, help from oppression........", "label": "clean"}

Gold helped them to survive in the turbulent economic transition period of 1992?2000. For others it is an income supplement in winter months when agricultural activities are limited.

And for those cases where encouragement won't be enough, the USOC needs to make sure that the NGBs have enforcement guidelines in place. One way to accomplish this is to put offseason checkpoints (e.g. fitness requirements, medical checkups, training program monitoring) in place.

{"text": "Legislation raises awkward issues. Although forced marriage itself is not a British criminal offence, the violent actions that often ensue are criminal offences, and any non-consensual sex is of course rape. Many victims have pointed out that they would not have been forced into marriage by their parents had forcible marriage been made a criminal offence. Yet there is the concern that if the practice is made a criminal offence, it would not be eliminated but only go underground, preventing legal action against this abhorrent trend. Hence the British government has proceeded cautiously in this regard. The English Forced Marriages (Civil Protection) Act 2007 is only a civil measure. But the pressure to take firm action is building. Visa regulations for young married people from abroad joining British spouses have been tightened. The British Parliament’s Home Affairs Select Committee has suggested that the subjects of forced marriages and honour killings be made a compulsory part of the sex and relationships curriculum in schools. Other agencies in the U.K. are now becoming aware of this problem. But this awareness must translate into concerted efforts to stop forced marriages, which are nothing but the criminal abuse of hapless women.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "A review of 61 studies on attitudes to trials has shed some light on why people participate in clinical trials (Edwards, Lilford and Hewison, 1998). In this review, it was found that over 60% of participants in seven studies stated that they did or would participate in clinical trials for altruistic reasons. However, in 4 studies, over 70% of people stated that they participated out of self-interest and in two studies over 50% of people stated that they would participate in such a study out of self-interest. As far as informed consent is concerned, in two studies (which were also part of this review) 47% of responding doctors thought that few patients were actually aware that they were taking part in a clinical trial. On the other hand, an audit of four further studies revealed that at least 80% of participants felt that they had made an autonomous decision. There is no proof whether such perceptions were accurate or not. The authors conclude that self-interest was more common than altruism amongst the reasons given for participating in clinical trials but draw attention to the poor quality of some of the studies reviewed thereby suggesting the need for further research. It should not be necessary for people to justify why they are willing to participate in clinical trials. Reasons for participating in research are further discussed in section 3.2.4 insofar as they relate to end-of-life research.", "label": "clean"}

Eugene Ingram, a CSI P.I., told Curtis that unless Curtis agreed to be deposed, he would lose his relationship with his Scientology mother. So Curtis went through ten hours of video deposition in which he was asked the same questions repeatedly. Afterwards, he was given an affidavit, attached hereto as Exhibit 47, which drafted and typed for Curtis' signature. It contained statements contrary to those he said in the deposition, but, because he was exhausted and afraid of losing his mother, he signed. On the 23rd March, Curtis wrote a second affidavit in Seattle to correct the first, attached hereto as Exhibit 48, stating, \"... I was asked the same question over and over in many different ways until I agreed to one small part of what they were talking about, but then it would be twisted to fit what they wanted to hear.

{"text": "In addition, while cycling into the city, and out to Hindmarsh on Saturday night, I might have expected to see a number of cyclists using the path to get into town. Guess how many I saw at 6.30 pm on what was a comparatively mild night? None. None at all. No other cyclists the whole trip. This is ridiculous; the route should be awash with people riding bikes. This particularly struck me as I came out under the bridge into Elder Park. It was deserted. What is a beautiful boulevard and riverfront promenade through the heart of Adelaide was completely desolate, not a soul in sight. This felt bizarre, where were all the people? One thing that struck me - if we want to get more people cycling into the city using Linear Park then it has to be safe, convenient, fun and amenable. Adelaide City Council has spent a lot of money on making Elder Park and the river front area of the city really attractive. But it is money wasted if people don’t go there. One reason I would think that most average cyclists wont ride a bike at night into the city via Linear park (and miss out on the safety and convenience of a quiet off-road cycling route) is that the approach to the city, both east and west is completely unlit. Pitch black it is from Hackney Bridge to the zoo, and once you go under the train line at Bonython Park and head out towards the brewery then you really want to make sure that you have eaten your carrots.

The trees will stabilize the soil cover, improve the soil structure and increase the nutrient content of the soil. As the trees have grown and become established, the risk of natural hazardous such as floods and mudslides has decreased. Up to 100 people received training on fruit tree planting and on soil and water conservation measures. The newly planted peach trees suffered in the heavy spring rains, and their growth was not as rapid as first hoped. But they survived and will most likely produce fruit in several years.

I do think that society is what will allow humans to evolve and grow and achieve our potential, partially because it is a situation in which we can, and must, give up our ego-based arrogance. But, as is clearly evidenced all around us, this is not what has happened so far. The ego and human arrogance is alive and kicking in Western societies.

In fact, a substance called falcarinol that is found in carrots has been found to reduce the risk of cancer, according to researchers at Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences (DIAS). Kirsten Brandt, head of the research department, explained that isolated cancer cells grow more slowly when exposed to falcarinol.

{"text": "Take women’s rights. That of course also goes far back. But it didn’t really become a substantial movement until the 1970s. There were germs of it in the 60s activism, but the way it began was small consciousness raising groups. Groups of women talking to each other and trying to break through the general assumption that this is the way it has to be. There are no choices, women are supposed to be property. In fact, if you look at American law, women remained essentially property until well into the 1970s. I mean there was no guaranteed legal right for women to serve on juries until about 1975 with a Supreme Court judgment. It developed mostly among women. There was a big crisis inside the activist movement in the sixties, incidentally, when young men who were doing courageous things, like resistance, had to somehow face the fact that they, too, were oppressors. It was difficult, it led to suicide in some cases. It’s a hard thing to deal with. But slowly it spread through much of the society, and now a lot of it is just taken for granted. Not everywhere, not to Rick Santorum, but quite broadly. And that’s the way things change, with workers’ rights and everything else. It’s no magic.

Albrecht (1989) suggests that the average low-cloud reflectivity could be increased if the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) increased due to emissions of SO2. It is proposed that CCN emissions should be released over the oceans, that the release should produce an increase in the stratocumulus cloud albedo only, and that the clouds should remain at the same latitudes over the ocean where the surface albedo is relatively constant and small.”", "label": "clean"}

Then we carefully wrap it with Parafilm, which is commonly used in laboratories. It holds the grafted tip tightly in place, seals the cutting area and helps the cut surfaces not to dry out. In two weeks, the tip tissue connects to the stock and it starts growing. The key to successful grafting is for the stock stem to be young and fresh (the inside green with no pith). Sometimes the Artemisia stem accepts the graft with some pith inside, but it’s difficult to get good results. Matching the stem thickness between stock stem and grafting tip is also important to connect the vascular systems together.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "NGOs reported isolated incidents of officers citing victims risking withdrawal of benefits when faced with reluctant victims; NGOs also reported continued challenges in getting law enforcement to recognize reluctant victims for protection purposes. Law enforcement continued to face challenges in identifying child victims of sex trafficking, particularly because the victims are often provided false identification by their traffickers and at least initially self-identified as adults. There was no targeted federal funding to support state child welfare agencies' anti-trafficking efforts. In some states, state child welfare agencies' missions did not formally extend to human trafficking, focusing instead on children who have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by caretakers and have not been expanded to reflect the anti-trafficking policy developments of the last decade. NGOs reported that these programs generally did not assist children over 14 years of age. State and local law enforcement, in some jurisdictions, was hampered by a lack of mandates, protocols, and training to identify and respond to child trafficking victims. The challenge of incorporating modern anti-trafficking concepts into these existing institutions has resulted in misidentification and referrals to juvenile justice or immigration systems rather than protective services. During the reporting period, the states of Illinois, Georgia, New York, Connecticut, and Florida created new procedures to increase identification or conducted initiatives to train child protection workers on human trafficking.", "label": "clean"}

Likewise, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) will play a critical role in financing issues in agricultural and rural development.As we seek to reduce hunger and provide food security, the US is focusing on women, who are pivotal to our efforts to achieve a food secure world. When you look at the statistics, in most developing countries, women produce between 60 and 80 percent of the food.

If you have a look at the Mono download page (http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html[^]) you will see that there are a packages available for some versions of the more common Linux distributions including Red Hat, SuSE, Fedora, and Novell Linux Desktop. Now a lot of Linux distributions will be compatible with some of these installation packages but specifying which ones are and which ones are not is well outside the scope of this introductory article. Unfortunately, if you are not using one of the listed distributions you'll have to either find out from your distributions documentation which of the packages are compatibly or you can download the Mono source and build Mono from that (covered in the Not for the faint hearted section below).

{"text": "By the end of the 12th century they had become holy days of obligation across Europe and involved such traditions as ringing bells for the souls in purgatory. \"Souling\", the custom of baking and sharing soul cakes for \"all crysten christened souls\", has been suggested as the origin of trick-or-treating. Groups of poor people, often children, would go door-to-door on All Saints/All Souls collecting soul cakes, originally as a means of praying for souls in purgatory. Similar practices for the souls of the dead were found as far south as Italy. Shakespeare mentions the practice in his comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1593), when Speed accuses his master of \"puling [whimpering or whining] like a beggar at Hallowmas.\" The custom of wearing costumes has been linked to All Saints/All Souls by Prince Sorie Conteh, who wrote: \"It was traditionally believed that the souls of the departed wandered the earth until All Saints' Day, and All Hallows' Eve provided one last chance for the dead to gain vengeance on their enemies before moving to the next world. In order to avoid being recognised by any soul that might be seeking such vengeance, people would don masks or costumes to disguise their identities\". In Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, Nicholas Rogers explained Halloween jack-o'-lanterns as originally being representations of souls in purgatory. In Brittany children would set candles in skulls in graveyards.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Among modern biblical scholars I have been able to identify at least three main lines of thought. The first group interprets the “spirits” as referring to the fallen angels (2 Peter 2:4). This is the position taken by Wilson (p. 3). Other scholars, however, have argued that the “spirits” referred to are not the fallen angels, but the spirits of men from the generation of the flood. Cranfield, for example, asserts, “The most probable interpretation is surely that which identifies the spirits in prison with the souls of men who perished in the flood.”24 A third group argues that the “spirits” include both men and angels. “We have therefore three choices here: ‘the spirits in prison’ are either fallen angels or the generation before the flood or those who lived before the coming of Christ generally.” Hanson favors a combination of all three of these possibilities. Whatever the case may be, they would all be spirits now dead. It is probably safest to conclude, as Hanson does, that in 1 Peter 3:18-20, “Christ is represented as having visited the place or the sphere, in which the fallen angels and the generations of men before his coming to earth were found” (i.e. Hades).25", "label": "clean"}

This process goes back and forth until a predetermined number of rounds have elapsed, or the players otherwise wish to end the game. When the final round is over, there may be an independent judge who determines who has played the best shots, and declares that person the winner, or players may play without a clear winner.

{"text": "In England the earliest known personification of Christmas does not describe him as old, or refer to him as 'father'. A carol attributed to Richard Smart, Rector of Plymtree from 1435 to 1477, takes the form of a sung dialogue between a choir and a figure representing Christmas, variously addressed as “Nowell”, “Sir Christemas” and “my lord Christemas”. He does not distribute presents to children but is associated with adult celebrations. Giving news of Christ’s birth, Christmas encourages everyone to eat and drink: \"Buvez bien par toute la campagnie,/Make good cheer and be right merry.\" However, the specific depiction of Christmas as a merry old man emerged in the early 17th century. The rise of puritanism had led to increasing condemnation of the traditions handed down from pre-Reformation times, especially communal feasting and drinking. As debate intensified, those writing in support of the traditional celebrations often personified Christmas as a venerable, kindly old gentleman, given to good cheer but not excess. They referred to this personification as \"Christmas\", \"Old Christmas\" or \"Father Christmas\".", "label": "clean"}

So she set about creating a way to achieve those smooth graceful curves that come from appliqué using a machine. Her technique, described in Piec-liqué Curves the New Way, is very interesting and best of all, it works. You can create beautiful curved shapes from piecing that look like appliqué using this fast, accurate, and fun method of simply stitching in the fold. Best of all, no pins are required! There are 36 blocks presented in the book and instructions are very easy to follow. Look for this book at your favorite bookseller.

{"text": "\"My idea of village swaraj is that it is a complete republic, independent of its neighbours for its own vital wants, and yet interdependent for many others in which dependence is a necessity. Thus every village's first concern will be to grow its own food crops and cotton for its cloth. It should have a reserve for its cattle, recreation and playground for adults and children. Then if there is more land available, it will grow useful money crops, thus excluding ganja, tobacco, opium and the like. The village will maintain a village theatre, school and public hall. It will have its own waterworks, ensuring clean water supply. This can be done through controlled wells or tanks. Education will be compulsory up to the final basic course. As far as possible every activity will be conducted on the co-operative basis. There will be no castes such as we have today with their graded untouchability. Non-violence with its technique of satyagraha and non-co-operation will be the sanction of the village community. There will be a compulsory service of village guards who will be selected by rotation from the register maintained by the village. The government of the village will be conducted by a Panchayat of five persons annually elected by the adult villagers, male and female, possessing minimum prescribed qualifications. These will have all the authority and jurisdiction required. Since there will be no system of punishments in the accepted sense, this Panchayat will be the legislature, judiciary and executive combined to operate for its year of office. Any village can become such a republic today without much interference even from the present Government whose sole effective connection with the villages is the exaction of the village revenue. I have not examined here the question of relations with the neighbouring villages and the centre if any. My purpose is to present an outline of village government. Here there is perfect democracy based upon individual freedom. The individual is the architect of his own government. The law of non-violence rules him and his government. He and his village are able to defy the might of a world. For the law governing every villager is that he will suffer death in the defence of his and his village's honour.", "label": "clean"}

Near the end of the Tech TV era, they were forced to plug G4's award show, G-Phoria on occasion, and mention that it's brought to you by EB Games and Jeep, even though they hadn't moved to Los Angeles to be with them yet. In addition, Sessler and Webb's appearance at G-Phoria on July 31, 2004, was their first time as G4 employees, just two weeks after the final San Francisco episode was filmed.

A segment of the Aß sequences is shown in the upper left corner and a random sequence is shown in the upper right. Each amino acid is designated by a capital letter. Typical antibodies recognize the linear sequence (from left to right) indicated in the horizontal boxes, which is unique to each sequence. When the peptides aggregate to form pathological oligomers, they line up in a parallel, in-register fashion, shown below. This gives rise to steric zippers that run up and down the sheet perpendicular to the sequence, shown in vertical boxes. Aggregation-dependent, disease-specific antibodies recognize the steric zippers from many different amyloid sequences. Zippers from F and V amino acids are shown in boxes, but there are potentially 20 different zippers; one for each of the 20 amino acids.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Locating the mammoth to which Ides' unnamed traveling companion referred is a little tricky. Makofskoi was, and still is, a small town on the western end of the portage between the Ob and Yenisei Rivers. Ides gave no indication of how far he meant when he said mammoth remains were found in the hills to the Northeast. My conclusion, based on Ides' phrase \"not far from hence,\" is that the find must have been close to Makofskoi. The explorer Adolf Nordenskiold, who traveled along the Arctic coast in the late nineteenth century, thought, because the hunter took the mammoth's foot to Turukhansk, that the find must have been close to that place. Turukhansk is 450 miles north of Makofskoi, which is not \"not far from hence.\" In Ides' day there were two major towns on the Yenesei where his companion might have sold the ivory, Turukhansk and Yeneseisk, which is only eighty miles from Makofskoi. That argues in Nordenskiold's favor. If the find was closer to Yeneseisk the only reasons the hunter would have had for going all the way to Turukhansk would have been if Turukhansk was offering a better price for ivory or if he had other business there. Without more evidence there's no way to settle the matter. If we split the difference between Makofskoi and Turukhansk we arrive at the Stony Tunguska River. Maybe the site was blown up in 1908 by the Tunguska meteorite.", "label": "clean"}

Well, not so fast. A neatly constructed Coney Dog can add a certain visual appeal that in some restaurants accentuates the good taste of it and in some cases covers up how bad it tastes. Colonial Dave’s version fell somewhere in the middle. The presentation said, “We’re going through the motions and if you’ve seen one Coney Dog, you’ve seen ‘em all.” The taste said, “We know we’re not the best, we don’t really care if we’re the best, but this is what we have to offer.” The sauce was a little unimaginative and heavy handed with the black pepper.

He describes how certain non-genetic factors that shape behavior may be inherited from one generation to the next. He discusses \"sexual freaks\" and sexual ambiguity in nature, and shows how in many ways, it is the norm in nature. He predicts the extinction of creationist thinking, and talks about how freaks of nature are a missed opportunity for those science advocates battling intelligent design and creationism, even as he also criticizes belief in \"evolution's design\" and \"magical genes.\" He contrasts his views with those of evolutionary psychology as regards brain development.

{"text": "A Williamson County game warden was patrolling a new section of a farm-to-market road that dissects several ranches that is not yet open to the public when he spotted a vehicle inside a ranch with a subject standing nearby drinking a beer. The warden watched the individual for about 15 minutes before he heard a gunshot in the distance beyond the truck. When the subject spotted the warden, he immediately got out his phone and appeared to calling someone. The warden started his truck and continued down the road giving the subject the perception that he was leaving. After waiting down the road for a while, the warden returned to the location where the subject was parked and spotted another male with his son near the truck shooting at several doves well after sunset. The warden parked his truck and walked several hundred yards to make contact with the hunters. When he arrived, the hunter with his son was no longer there. The lone hunter was in compliance with state laws and told the warden that the other man was his cousin and was heading back to the house. The man was stalling answering questions about the other hunter as if buying time for his cousin’s escape. The warden was able to make it back to his patrol truck, drive to the front of the property, and find the hunter before he got away. As the warden tried to conduct a compliance check on the man, he denied hunting and became verbally aggressive. The warden advised Williamson County of the situation and requested back up. When two deputies arrived, the man became more compliant, admitted to hunting and said he hid his shotgun in his cousin’s truck. It was discovered that the man not only shot at a dove after sunset, but he did not have a hunting license, or identification.", "label": "clean"}

In a sense, the counterculture was America's own fractured shamanism, seething with untamed energies and magical phantasms. By taking root within this intensely vibrant culture, the Western dharma was able to make the transition from a marginal pursuit of intellectuals and cultural mavericks to the influential if constrained mass phenomenon it is today.

The mining sector is important nationally, and the central government has been the main beneficiary of the taxes from mining operations. The locals want a fair share, and because they view the mining operators as more capable than the central government they increasingly seek more benefits from the companies. Rather than step into the breach to negotiate with the parties, the central government has essentially left the mining operators and the locals to their own devices.", "label": "clean"}

The child of rape, Leslie’s mother and stepfather abused him horribly, forcing him to sleep in the symbolically important cider room. Eventually, Leslie rebelled and killed them, hacking his stepfather up with a hand scythe and lynching his mother in the apple orchard. When the town discovered the crime, an angry mob threw him over a waterfall into an icy river. As Zelda Rubenstein explains in her malfunctioning babydoll voice: “That cold, bodies don’t come back up. Turtles picked his bones clean.” On the twentieth anniversary of his death, Leslie has returned to exact vengeance on the community. As the film matures, it is revealed that Leslie is not what he claims to be and has merely glommed onto the legend of Leslie Vernon as part of his bid to join the ranks of “Jay, Fred and Mike.”", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "As you can see, up until now I have not been a regular review junkie but this is the third time I have used Magic Touch so I feel confident in saying without doubt that they are hands down the best and most honest Auto Body Shop around which is saying a lot for their type of work. I always get hives when needing to do any auto body work and feel I don't have enough time but that I need to shop, haggle and check at least two or three places to make sure I am getting a fair price. This is one of the few places I can now confidently say that I just don't. I have had my share of nightmares at auto body shops that not only jacked up the price but also took forever to fix my car. I have a Mercedes which I sometimes curse for the damge repair cost but I don't feel like Magic Touch Jacks up my cost for that reason. They have always honored their original estimate and above that cleaned my car and done more then expected which I would think is possibly just good luck 2 out of 3 times but 3 out of 3?... and after a lot more interaction and several other friends reviews confirming the same I am now convinced that this is the way they operate and I have personally confirmed that they genuinely seem to pay attention and care about honest work and long-term clientele. I cannot say enough good things about Magic Touch and if you see similar postings online it's because I am making it a point to post on as many review forums as I can. I only hope someone feeling overwhelmed with all the Auto Body Shops in Miami will have the opportunity of enjoying the great service this shop provides.", "label": "clean"}

In one of the biggest freefalls in Nielsen ratings history, Laverne & Shirley went from the number one-watched show in the country (for the second year running) for the 1978-1979 season, to the bottom of the barrel when ABC inexplicably swapped the timeslots of two of their most successful shows: Laverne & Shirley out of its established Tuesday 8:30pm slot, with what the network thought was their next big smash, the much-hyped Angie, starring Saturday Night Fever's Donna Pescow and Airplane's Robert Hayes at its Thursday 8:30pm time slot (Angie had garnered a rather astounding 5th most-watched show of the previous season with just a mid-season start in February). Wrong on both counts. The move decimated both show's ratings, with once-promising Angie cancelled by the spring of 1980, and Laverne & Shirley first quickly hustled to Monday nights at 8:00pm (where it got creamed by Little House on the Prairie), and then back to its Tuesday 8:30pm slot in February. Ratings ticked up, but not even close enough for Laverne & Shirley to crack the Nielsen Top Thirty―a humiliating, completely unnecessary showing for a series that wasn't \"broke\" in the first place. Laverne & Shirley's sixth season would see the ratings rise higher again...but nowhere near its previous glory.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "¿Quién, dónde y qué es México? Con el transcurso del tiempo, las definiciones y los límites de México han ido cambiando. Se conocía como México al Imperio Azteca y toda el área donde se hablaba náhuatl —actualmente la región circundante a la ciudad de México. Durante 300 años los colonizadores españoles se refirieron a ella como Nueva España. Cuando en 1821 México resurgió como una nación soberana, sus fronteras se extendían desde California a Guatemala. En ese entonces era un antiguo e inmenso territorio conformado por regiones étnica, lingüística y económicamente diversas que luchaban por adquirir unidad nacional. Texas (en ese entonces parte de los estados mexicanos de Coahuila y Tejas) era una región fronteriza lejos de las densas urbes y de los fértiles valles de México central, donde se reclutaban inmigrantes de los Estados Unidos. En el año 1836 este territorio mexicano se declaró como república independiente (y más tarde, estado de EE.UU.), convirtiéndose en el primer calderón de la cultura mexicoamericana. Hacia 1853, el gobierno de México, el vecino débil de un Estados Unidos en expansión, había perdido el territorio de los actuales estados de California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Nuevo México, Texas y partes de Colorado y Wyoming. A pesar de la imposición de un nuevo límite fronterizo, la presencia histórica y ocupacional de los españoles, mexicanos y pueblos indígenas, junto a sus descendientes mestizos, constituiría a lo largo del tiempo una influencia determinante para el desarrollo del Oeste Americano.", "label": "non-english"}

The Islamic world is not using its resources effectively, for many of its members lack the infrastructure and technology to increase the production and use their natural resources to develop their industries. Therefore, the resources' contributions to the country's economy are limited to export earnings. These countries do not have the means to process their own crude oil, use it in their industrial complexes, or to develop their industries. Worse still, some Muslim nations do not even have the necessary means to explore and research their natural resources or to discover and extract them.

{"text": "May12 @ @ RandyP comments: mypad:FaithOfJesuskjv@Mark:3:20-30 - The friends close to Jesus suspect the toll of this ministry on a man to be greater than it actually is on Jesus. Perhaps they are beginning to feel the wear on themselves. Jesus had just returned from a prayer filled time of reinvigoration and reorganization; did they? Jesus' daily life was filled with such moments even in the midst of such business; was theirs? Even when the day became too busy and too crowded even to eat, Jesus would spend entire nights soaking in the Fathers communion; did they? Those that oppose Jesus never seem to tire because there are so many of them coming from so many directions; an endless supply of them so that one individual never has to tire. Add to it that even for one opponent it is so much easier to portray a foe in a negative light than it is to advance the cause and work of the much better light. At this point opponents don't have to reason nor defend what they are saying, just throw it out there like a sniper then run and hide till the next. Eventually the opponent however comes to the point where He has discounted the integrity and work of the Holy Spirit to such a measure that he either passively or vigorously aligns his own self with the workings of the Devil. If the Spirit is working to establish Jesus as Messiah and you are working against that, well matters have become quiet grave for you mister junior devil. Some people might do this for a time, come to the realization of who Jesus is and then repent. For those who continue on however, repentance and salvation are far from reach. What forgiveness from damnation would one ever hope to have? This is the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, not finding repentance, not allow the Spirit's work to continue inside of you. The faith of our Lord is well reasoned, though we may not allow ourselves to see it as so. Friend's think He is beside Himself, enemies think that He is an agent of Satan, neither of which can defend their statements. Not only is He in line, He does everything spiritual to keep Himself in line. Do we?", "label": "clean"}

Analysts think that paper losses may have been particularly large at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), which is considered the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. Some analysts think ADIA has about $450 billion under management, but others say it could have more than double that amount. While ADIA won't disclose its total assets or precise allocations, officials at the fund, which is a sophisticated investor knowledgeable about the whole gamut of asset classes, earlier this year provided visiting BusinessWeek reporters with documents showing that the fund's benchmarks called for having 55 percent to 71 percent of its portfolio invested in equities and a further 12 percent to 28 percent in so-called alternatives: real estate, hedge funds, and private equity. Brad Setser, a geoeconomics fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who pegs ADIA's total holdings at the low end, figures the fund has notched around $150 billion in losses.", "label": "clean"}

They race along at a nice clip and both Morrison and Waid, along with Christopher Priest, pack a lot of story – relative to what we’ve become accustomed to in this current comic market – into the pages provided. For my money, I felt like I got far more value from this book, which has five different adventures in it, than I did in the previous volume “Rock of Ages,” which was a single six-issue storyline.", "label": "clean"}

Beyond merely auditing the tally, this allows any person who wishes, to completely re-do the tally from scratch, using any software of their choosing, or even by printing out the ballot rankings and sorting them by hand, accomplishing a complete recount.

The company said \"technical issues\" have delayed the scaling up of Imvamune production, but the problems have been identified and corrective actions taken. The 18 million remaining doses under the firm's $500 million contract with the US government will be delivered from 2011 through 2013, officials said. The company began increasing production after it received delivery clearance from the Food and Drug Administration earlier in 2010. Imvamune is intended for use in people who have weakened immunity or other contraindications to conventional smallpox vaccine, which uses a replicating strain of vaccinia virus, a close relative of the smallpox virus. The US government previously stockpiled hundreds of millions of doses of the conventional vaccine for use in case of a smallpox attack by bioterrorists.", "label": "clean"}

Kadri has actually been really impressive on more than just the scoresheet, as he has done a fine job of carrying the play at even strength for the Leafs. These two along with Mikhail Grabovski and James Van Riemsdyk have done the majority of scoring for Toronto thus far which has helped take Leafs fans mind off their star player Phil Kessel who has yet to light the lamp this year.

{"text": "There is some suggestion that knowledge of events associated with onset is “intriguing, but unnecessary for successful treatment.” (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299) I call shenanigans. There is a significant connection between the onset of TM and the patient enduring loss, perceived loss, and/or trauma. Time is well spent exploring the specific environmental stressors that precipitated the disorder. Although ignoring circumstances surrounding onset might be prudent when employing strict behavioral treatment paradigms, it seems like a terrible waste of time to endure suffering without identifying some underlying meaning or purpose that would otherwise be missed if we overlook onset specifics. “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” (Frankl, 1997, p. 86) If we acknowledge that all behavior is purposeful, then we must know and understand the circumstances around onset if we will ever understand the purpose of said behavior. I liken this to a difference in professional opinion and personal preference because either position can be reasonably justified, but in the end the patient should make the ultimate decision about whether or not to explore onset contributions vis-à-vis “imagery dialogue” or a similar technique. (Young, Klosko, & Weishaar, 2003, p. 123) If such imagery techniques are unsuccessful or undesired by the client, a psychodynamic conversation between “internal parts of oneself” can add clarity to the persistent inability of the client to delay gratification. (Ingram, 2012, p. 292) Such explorations are likely to be time consuming, comparatively speaking, and should not be explored with patients who are bound by strict EAP requirements or managed care restrictions on the type and length of treatment. Comorbid developmental disabilities and cognitive deficits may preclude this existential exploration. I employ the exploration of existential issues of origin in the interest of increasing treatment motivation, promoting adherence, enhancing the therapeutic milieu, and thwarting subsequent lapses by anchoring cognitive dissonance to a concrete event.", "label": "clean"}

But in so far as the maritime obligations may, consistently with those principles, be separately adjudicated, there is no objection to the jurisdiction of the admiralty pro tanto. This is clearly intimated in Turner v. Beacham, [24 Fed.] Fed.Cas. [page 350,] No. 14252, and The Pennsylvania, 154 F. 9 (C.C.A.2), though the decisions did not require such a holding.

Although you dont need to stress over wearing the latest styles like girls, there are some easy changes that you can make to ensure a good look. As far as spring styles go, items like short sleeve button down shirts are hot, especially when paired with a lightweight sweater. For bottoms, shorts are always a good choice as long as they are not too short or too tight. Although pants come in various styles for guys, the boot cut, looser fit is usually the most universally flattering.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "To give the Reader an account, why the following Treatise, is suffer'd, to pass abroad so maim'd, and imperfect, I must inform him that 'tis now long since, that to gratify an ingenious Gentleman ; I set down some of the Reasons that kept me from fully acquiescing either in the Peripatetical ; or Chymical Doctrine, of the Material Principles of mixt Bodies. This Dircourse some years after falling into the hands of some Learned men, had the good luck to be so favourably receiv'd, and advantageously spoken of by them, that having had more then ordinary Invitations given me to make it publick, I thought fit to review it, that might retrench some things that seem'd fit to be shewn to every Reader, And substitute some of those other things that occurr'd to me of the tryals and observations I had since made. What became of my papers, I elsewhere mention in a Preface where I complain of it : But since I writ That, I found many sheets that belong'd to the subjects I am now about to discourse of. Wherefore seeing that I had then in my hands as much of the first Dialogue as was requisite to state the Case, and serve for an Introduction as well to the conference betwixt Carneades and Eleutherius, as to same other Dialogues, which for certain reasons are not now herewith publish'd, I resolv'd to supply, as well as I could, the Contents of a Paper belonging to the secund of the following Discourses, which I could not possibly retrive, though it were the chief of them all. And having once more try'd the Opinion of Friends, but not of the same, about this imperfect work, I found it such, that I was content in complyance with their Desires, that not only it should be publish'd, but that it should be publish'd as soon as conveniently might be. I had indeed all along the Dialogues spoken of my self, as of a third Person ; For, they containing Discourses which were among the first treatises that I ventur'd long ago to write of matters Philosophical, I had reason to desire, with the Painter, to , and bear what men would say of them, before I own'd my self to be their Author. But besides that now I find, 'tis not unknown to many who it is that writ them, I am made to believe that 'tis not inexpedient, they would be known to come from a Person not altogether a stranger to Chymical Affairs. And I made the lesse scruple to let them come abroad uncompleated, partly, because my affairs and Prae-ingagements to publish divers other Treatises allow'd me small hopes of being able in agreat while to compleat these Dialogues. And partly, because I am not unapt to think, that they may come abroad seasonably enough, though not for the Authors reputation, yet for other purposes. For I observe, that of late Chymistry begins, as indeed it deserves, to be cultivated by Learned Men who before despis'd it ; and to be pretended to by many who never cultivated it, that they may be thought not to ignore it : Whence it is come to passe, that divers Chymical Notions about Matters Philosophical are taken for granted and employ'd, and so adopted by very eminent writers both Naturalists and Physitians. Now this I fear may prove somewhat prejudicial to the Advancement of solid Philosophy : For though I am a great Lover of Chymical Experiments, and though I have no mean esteem of divers Chymical Remedies, yet I distinguish these from their Notions about the causes of things, and their manner of Generation. And for ought I can hitherto discern, there are a thousand Phaenomena in Nature, besides Multitude of Accidents relating to the humane Body ,which will scarcely be clearly & satisfactorily made out by them that confine themselves to deduce things from Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, and the other Notions peculiar to the Chymists, without taking much more Notice than they are wont to do, of the Motions and Figures, of the small Parts of Matter, and the other more Catholick and Fruitful affections of Bodies. Wherefore it will not perhaps be now unseasonable to let our Carneades warne Men, not to subscribe to the grand Doctrine of the Chymists touching their three Hypostatical Principles, till they have a little examin'd it, and consider'd, how they can clear it from his Objections, divers of which 'tis like they may never have thought on ; since a Chymist scarce would, and none but a Chymist could propose them. I hope also it will not be unacceptable to several Ingenious Persons, who are unwilling to determine of any important Controversie, without a previous consideration of what may be said on both sides, and yet have greater desires to understand Chymical Matters, than Opportunities of learning them, to find here together, besides several Experiments of my own purposely made to Illustrate the Doctrine of the Elements, divers others scarce to be met with, otherwise then Scatter'd among many Chymical Books. And to Find these Associated Experiments so Deliver'd as that an Ordinary Reader, if he be but Acquainted with the usuall Chymical Termes, may easily enough Understand Them ; and even a wary One may safely rely on Them. These Things I add, because a Person any Thing vers'd in the writings of Chymists cannot but Discern by their obscure, ambiguous, and almost AEnigmatical way of expressing what they pretend to Teach, that they have no Mind to be understood at all, but by the Sons of Art ( as they call them ) nor to be Understood even by these Without Difficulty and Hazardous Tryalls. lnsomuch that same of Them Scarce ever speak so candidly, as when they make use of that known Chymical Sentence ; . And as the obscurity of what some Writers deliver makes it very difficult to be understood ; so the Unfaithfulness of too many others makes it unfit to be reli'd on. For though unwillingly, Yet I must for the truths sake, and the Readers, warne him not to be forward to believe Chymical Experiments when they are set down only by way of Prescriptions, and not of Relations ; that is, unless he that delivers them mentions his doing it upon his own particular knowledge, or upon the Relation of some credible person, avowing it upon his own experience. For I am troubled, I must complain, that even Eminent writers, both Physitians and Philosophers, whom I can easily name, if it be requir'd , have of late suffer'd themselves to be so far impos'd upon, as to Publish and Build upon Chymical Experiments, which questionless they never try'd ; for if they had, they would, as well as I, have found them not to be true. And indeed it were to be wish'd, that now that those begin to quote Chymical Experiments that are not themselves Acqainted with Chymical Operations, men would Leave off that Indefinite Way of Vouching the Chymists say this, or the Chymists affirme that, and would rather for each Experiment they alledge name the Author or Authors, upon whose credit they relate it ; For, by this means they would secure themselves from the suspition of falshood ( to which the other Practice Exposes them ) and they would Leave the Reader to Judge of what is fit for him to Believe of what is Deliver'd, whilst they employ not their own great names to Countenance doubtfull Relations ; and they will also do Justice to the Inventors or Publishers of true Experiments, as well as upon the Obtruders of false ones. Whereas by that general Way of quoting the Chymists, the candid Writer is Defrauded of the particular Praise, and the Impostor escapes the Personal Disgrace that is due to him.", "label": "clean"}

A language class is enhanced by the translation of recipes or stories from other cultures.

{"text": "Elimination of defective mitochondria is essential for the health of long-lived, postmitotic cells. To gain insight into this process, we examined programmed mitochondrial clearance in reticulocytes. BNIP3L is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that is required for clearance. It has been suggested that BNIP3L functions by causing mitochondrial depolarization, activating autophagy, or engaging the autophagy machinery. Here we showed in mice that BNIP3L activity localizes to a small region in its cytoplasmic domain, the minimal essential region (MER). The MER is a novel sequence, which comprises three contiguous hydrophobic amino acid residues, and flanking charged residues. Mutation of the central leucine residue causes complete loss of BNIP3L activity, and prevents rescue of mitochondrial clearance. Structural bioinformatics analysis predicts that the BNIP3L cytoplasmic domain lacks stable tertiary structure, but that the MER forms an α-helix upon binding to another protein. These findings support an adaptor model of BNIP3L, centered on the MER.", "label": "clean"}

What's more, they note, this law won't mean that cops will simply be able to stop anyone on the street and demand proof of legality. Interestingly, they made the same claim about the original law even though it required police officers to make little more than eye contact before launching a full-blown inquiry into someone's immigration status.", "label": "clean"}

This effort saved Nassau County taxpayers approximately $11 million in health insurance premiums for 2009 and approximately $116 million for local schools and governments. I will also be working to recoup a portion of the excess NYSHIP premiums charged in prior years – an amount equal to $540 million statewide and $21 million for Nassau County, that could be made as a one month premium holiday for all NYSHIP participants.

{"text": "Available N requirements (soil N + fertilizer N) for MEY increased linearly with water for both growing seasons. The slopes of the lines for the two seasons were similar and indicate that N requirements increased approximately 8 lbs N with each inch of additional water. However, the intercepts for the lines differ for the two seasons. As a result, it took approximately 35 to 40 lbs/a less N in 1994 to achieve MEY than in 1993 at similar water levels. Background soil N analysis levels for the two seasons were similar. However, barley residue from the preceding crop was burned prior to seeding the 1994 oat crop. This likely enhanced organic N mineralization and resulted in the lower calculated N requirement. Typically, most cereal growers do not burn their residue, hence under most situations the upper line in Figure 3 is probably the better predictor of fertilizer N needs. Using this approach, sufficient fertilizer N should be applied to achieve 60 lbs available N/a where 8 inches of available water (soil water + rainfall) is expected during the growing season. If water conditions improve, N application is increased approximately 8 lbs/a per inch increase in available water.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "MR. CARDARELLI: Well, I think what they're doing right now is to ease monetary policy aggressively, and they're easing it aggressively especially in the economies where mortgage rate is higher where the mortgage market is more developed in the sense that it's easier for households to access mortgages, to use homes as collateral, to extract equity out of homes. And that's actually a very important conclusion of the chapter. What Simon said it's true, so we're recommending a more symmetric approach within this risk management monetary policy approach, but this is especially true, I would stress, in economies where mortgage markets are more developed; in economies where mortgage markets are less developed, there is sort of a less urgency in a way, to adopt this kind of behavior. And it's sort of something that you see going on right now so, for example, the Fed has been easing more aggressively than the ECB. There are structural differences in mortgage markets between the U.S. and Europe. Europe, according to our indexes, is—most of the countries in Europe have less developed mortgage markets than the U.S. This is consistent with what we're saying in our model, in our research saying in these kinds of economies when mortgage markets are less developed serve there's less volatility coming out of development in the housing sector. So, there is less of a need for monetary policy to respond strongly to house prices. For economies like the U.S. with a very developed mortgage market, there's more of a point in responding to house prices when things start changing as rapidly as they are now.", "label": "clean"}

We show here that a 2–3 bp mispositioning of the nucleosome covering the TATA box at PHO5 induces a dependency on the acetylatable lysine residues of the histone H4 N-terminal region and on the TFIID-associated bromodomain factor Bdf1. This dependency arises either through fusion of the PHO5 promoter to a lacZ reporter or by mutation of the TATA box in the natural gene. The results suggest that promoters in which the TATA box is either absent or poorly accessible on the surface of a nucleosome may compensate by using Bdf1 bromodomains and acetylated H4 tails to anchor TFIID to the promoter during the initial stages of transcription activation. We propose that nucleosome positioning at the nucleotide level provides a subtle, but highly effective, mechanism for gene regulation.", "label": "clean"}

I sometimes love books for language, regardless of plot (e.g. Tove Jansson’s writing) but equally sometimes plot takes precedence over language. And Lindsay manages to combine the two in a way which leads to a beautiful surrealism by the end, and produces a novel which is quite unlike anything else I’ve ever read.

{"text": "A main character’s name often gives you the first clue to what a novel is “about,” especially when it’s also the title of the book.

A just-picked olive is as bitter — and the color olive is as drab — as the title character of the book appears at first to be. The salt added during curing removes the bitterness just as love, the salt in this book, removes some of Olive’s. In Ireland a kitter is a left-handed person. And Olive is at least metaphorically left-handed: She’s out of sync with others in her coastal town in Maine. A surname database says of Kitter: “This is an Olde English or Anglo-Saxon pre 10th Century name which derives from the word ‘Cyta’ and is a nickname of the medieval period generally given to one of fairly violent attitudes.” Olive’s views of life are “fairly violent,” especially in the first story, when they are so angry they verge on caricature.", "label": "clean"}

It represents an important step forward in the relations of the two organisations, which on the basis of this text can chart a list of common actions, to be carried out in the years to come. It can also be the basis on which BirdLife`s Partners can promote similar initiatives at the national level.", "label": "clean"}

Applications in response to this RFA will be for short-term awards involving the development of the technologies and standardized measures of success.

Likewise, Duncan has promised to subsidize states to develop data systems for the evaluation of teachers by the gains their students make on standardized tests. Yet because the only standardized tests that can be used for this purpose are in math and reading, teachers being evaluated in this way will have even more incentives to stress only basic skills, and downplay other aspects of a well-rounded curriculum.

That's not actually a very high number compared to other countries, countries with much larger overvaluation. One of the reasons why Spain has already gone through a huge correction in terms of housing prices, in terms of year-on-year growth they went from double digits, actually larger than 20 percent, to basically zero over the last quarter.

It might sound weird, of course, because singing is a physical job, but then basically the whole day you're waiting for these 50 minutes that we play on this tour but before the tour I was so completely stressed out and had lots of things to do. I was singing the next Stratovarius stuff and then I was composing melody and lyrics for two songs for Janne Wirman (Children Of Bodom) and his project Warmen. But was just two days before I had to leave for this tour and then we had to rehearse the last 3 days for it - and then also back to work for the new band that signed my label, called Wingdom. So there was so much work before the actual tour and when I was on the airplane from Helsinki to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Madrid, I couldn't do anything for the other things, I was already on the tour, on a holiday. And then my stress level went down immediately; especially after the first gig in Madrid when I noticed \"FUCK, this is a good band that I have!\" I really think they are very good players so it's good to be on this tour. And I haven't been supporting - the last tours I did with Stratovarius were headlining tours since 1999 or something, that's the last 6 years, so it's nice to be a support, I think. Of course you can't use all this stage-space et cetera but then the good thing is when you have finished you open your first beer and the main band is about to start, so… it's much less stress.

In like manner the same form of transmission has generally prevailed under nature throughout the same groups, although marked exceptions to this rule occur. Thus within the same family or even genus, the sexes may be identically alike, or very different in colour. Instances have already been given in the same genus, as with sparrows, flycatchers, thrushes and grouse. In the family of pheasants the sexes of almost all the species are wonderfully dissimilar, but are quite alike in the eared pheasant or Crossoptilon auritum. In two species of Chloephaga, a genus of geese, the male cannot be distinguished from the females, except by size; whilst in two others, the sexes are so unlike that they might easily be mistaken for distinct species.*", "label": "clean"}

The white one specifically, (my gem, goddess, temptress) is made with a white-silver coat over brushed aluminum. They’re also 98% recyclable, so in a moment of insanity, you decide you don’t want this chair anymore (and I’m not around to take it off your hands), you can rest assured knowing that it can be disassembled and kicked to the curb to be picked up for recycling.

The Renaissance marked a lessening of the intolerance and censorship of the medieval clergy. Art, literature, science, and philosophy were freed from shibboleths of Aristotle, Church doctrine, and formalistic conventions. But California has of yet had no such renaissance. In our closed, anti-scientific, and deductive way of thinking, Solyndra was a success. Drilling for cheap natural gas in the Monterey Shale formation would be seen as failure. When our governor told Rick Perry that Californians did not need to cool off in 110 degree heat through “fossil fuel”-fed air conditioning, he did not mean that solar panels were energizing green air conditioners in Barstow, but rather that our elites on the coast have natural air conditioning; it’s called the Pacific Ocean. And although wind and solar provide miniscule amounts of California energy, it matters little, given that coastal elites enjoy 70 degree weather year-round and keep their power bills low. PG&E’s and Southern California Edison’s astronomical energy costs are for “little people,” the middle classes in the hot and cold interior and mountains.

In such an environment, it’s very difficult for the governments to be persistent in reforming societies, which on the other hand is a necessity.

In the MF59-adjuvanted group (n = 1181) versus the non-adjuvanted group (n = 545) there was no increase in the incidence of unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events. As expected, solicited local or systemic reactions occurred more frequently in MF59-adjuvanted subjects; however, a majority of reactions were mild and transient.

{"text": "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and civil war, Tajikistan?s electrical infrastructure was in need of significant investment. Among the most affected areas was the Mountain Badakhshan Autonomous Province, where economic and human development was stifled during the cold winter months as a result of a lack of electricity for heating and the consequent closure of schools, health centres and businesses. Many of the region?s 220 000 residents resorted to wood fuel for their heating and cooking needs during the winter, resulting in the decimation of local forests. The AKFED, in partnership with the International Finance Corporation, formed the PamirEnergy Company in 2002 to address the situation. Over US$ 30 million has since been invested by the company to repair the electrical infrastructure of the province and to expand hydroelectric capacity. In the wake of these efforts, almost 90 per cent of the region?s inhabitants now have access to electricity while tariff subsidies have ensured that even the poorest households are able to access power.", "label": "clean"}

But even with all of this formidable knowledge, the crew of Voyager have failed to incorporate transwarp into their ship after years of trying. Why? Because their technology isn't up to the task. Even when 7 of 9 modified the ship to support transwarp, it was found that their systems lacked the necessary precision and control to make it work.

Parts of that organism are relatively independent from the whole. A tapeworm can be cut apart and the parts are still able to live.

{"text": "Studies show that many older adults who die by suicide — up to 75 percent — visited a physician within a month before death.30 These findings point to the urgency of improving detection and treatment of depression to reduce suicide risk among older adults. The risk of depression in the elderly increases with other illnesses and when ability to function becomes limited. For example, depression is associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease in older men and women.31 Depressive disorder is not a normal part of aging. Depression can and should be treated when it occurs at the same time as other medical illnesses. Untreated depression can delay recovery or worsen the outcome of these other illnesses. A review of the literature suggests that periodic screening at regular intervals, at least for people with risk factors, is widely recommended. For example, the USPSTF noted that people who are at greater risk for depression “are considered at risk throughout their lifetime.”32 Risk factors include family history of depression, female gender, and the presence of other psychiatric disorders or chronic disease.33 For example, a 2005 analysis concluded that depressive disorders are “associated with increased prevalence of chronic diseases,” which “appears attributable to depressive disorders precipitating chronic disease and to chronic disease exacerbating symptoms of depression.”34 Depression screening can be performed quickly, conveniently, and at low cost.35 Moreover, depression screening appears low-risk; the USPSTF did not find evidence that addressed risks or harms associated with depression screening in adults and elderly patients in primary care.36 Given all these circumstances, it would be prudent for Medicare to cover depression screening at least annually - - or more frequently if other circumstances (such as the presence of one or more of the risk factors noted above) suggest that more frequent screening is appropriate, though we recognize that providing more frequent screening could present challenges to the provider.", "label": "clean"}

This outrageous request—to work as laborers in a foreign province—almost causes a rebellion, but eventually the Satsuma samurai swallow their pride and travel to Gifu Prefecture, where they work themselves to the bone, despite the shame it causes. \"True honor lies at the bottom of our heart. It is invisible to others, and it can never be violated!\" But is the whole dam-building scheme just an elaborate plot by the Tokugawa to drain the wealth and manpower of Satsuma?

That’s your worst-case scenario, but the greatest number of ranking combinations actually used in a precinct was only 131. The total number of rankings used citywide, in over 500 precincts with 150,000 ballots cast, was 1,684, which is a great deal smaller than the 8,000 possible combinations.

And I believe contrary to what some say that all 120 at least were there, not just the 12. Some have said that only the 12 at this point received the baptism of the Spirit. I think that would have left 108 people seriously wondering what was going on and it would have not been complete in accord with the baptism of the Holy Spirit in the sense of the birth of the church as it would have left some out.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "February22 @ @ RandyP comments: mypad:FaithOfJesuskjv@Matthew:13:24-30 WHILE MEN SLEPT - The Kingdom sowed but, certain men were apparently given the responsibility of watching over the field and did not. While they slept the enemy came in and planted near identical yet false seed. This parable goes hand in hand with the original Parable of the Sower. Wouldn't it be good to know that along with your personal struggle to bring forth fruit that there is a field (world) of other believers going through the same process? Wouldn't it be equally as good to know that not everyone that you would think by appearance is of the same stock? No one would know until the final fruit was harvested. It is interesting that all the enemy had to do is plant the seed and then go about his way. Are these darnel seeds subject to the same process of root and depth and parching sunlight as the wheat? Most likely. Is one required to grow the other? Apparently not. What then is the difference and how can they be identified? Not even the servants from above can tell until the final fruit is bore. Once intermingled, removing the one would uproot the other. Imagine for instance the prospects of the Protestant church if ever the Catholic Church was removed or vise versa. The faith of our Lord is in that while this did not need to happen it was going to and did happen because men do sleep. It is deceptive to say that all paths lead to God when not all seed leads to the same fruit, when not all seed is planted to the same intent by the same kingdom. While we cannot identify the measure now amongst ourselves, He certainly can when all things come to fruition.", "label": "clean"}

Therefore, you’re dealing with a soul, and the soul has these various burdens and obstacles. He understood as a pastor that you have to reach out to a person where there are and not expect too much. As Christ said you don’t want to put new wine into old bottles. So he was very careful with that.

WWUH stayed on the air throughout, staffed by three volunteers, Allison Rasmussen, Mark Smith and John Ramsey, who were literally snowed into the Gengras Student Union for three days. The snowdrifts were up to the second story windows. For the first twelve hours or so, the volunteers thoroughly enjoyed the experience of having the radio station all to themselves. However, sometime in the second day of the event, two things happened: First, they realized that they were unable to leave the building because none of the outside doors could be opened because of the snow drifted up three to four feet high in front of them! Luckily, none of them had claustrophobia. Second, they ran out of money. They had been eating out of the vending machines on the first floor of Gengras, which at that time consisted of a number of machines that dispensed all sorts of goodies. There was a machine that dispensed candy, another soft drinks, another for ice cream, a fourth coffee and another for things like hot dogs, tuna sandwiches and even microwave popcorn (which had recently made its debut in the consumer marketplace). The food that the volunteers consumed from these machines while they were trapped in the building while certainly not nutritionally redeeming but it kept the hunger pangs away and probably provided the caffeine and energy necessary to operate the station hour after hour. Public Safety came to the station's aid by ferrying in food to our volunteers, who produced over 72 hours of programming between the three of them.", "label": "clean"}

It’s not to say they shouldn’t have confidence or speak up and disagree, but successful businesses don’t have room or time for a battle of egos that takes focus away from the issues or decisions at hand. Additionally, lack of humility often means that employees are afraid to admit when they’re wrong or ask for help. That won’t work in the early days of a startup.

{"text": "From: UFO UpDates - Toronto <ufoupdates.nul> Date: Fri, 04 Feb 2005 08:16:06 -0500 Fwd Date: Fri, 04 Feb 2005 08:16:06 -0500 Subject: Britain's X-Files Said UFOs Were Waste Of Time Source: The Times of London - UK http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1469190,00.html 02-04-05 How Britain's X-Files Said That UFOs Were Just A Waste Of Time By David Charter Secret committee dismissed reports of flying saucers more than 50 years ago The truth is out there somewhere... but it has taken the Ministry of Defence 54 years to release secret papers ruling out the existence of UFOs. Minutes of the Government=92s Flying Saucer Working Party have finally been made public in answer to the ultimate request under the Freedom of Information Act =97 do aliens exist? In the document, marked \"Secret\" and \"Discreet\", officials rejected sightings of UFOs by RAF personnel as well as a series of reports of \"luminous bodies\" by members of the public. The working party concluded: \"We consider that no progress will be made by attempting further investigation of uncoordinated and subjective evidence and that positive results could only be obtained by organising throughout the country, or the world, continuous observation of the skies by a co-ordinated network of visual observers, equipped with photographic apparatus and supplemented by a network of radar stations and sound locators. \"We should regard this, on the evidence so far available, as a singularly profitless enterprise. We accordingly recommend very strongly that no further investigation of reported mysterious aerial phenomena be undertaken, unless and until some material evidence becomes available.\" With that, the Flying Saucer Working Party dissolved itself in June 1951, never to meet again. But in the absence of any details of its deliberations, UFO sightings have continued unabated over Britain as shown by the recent release of reams of reports from members of the public. The latest MoD document shows that 91 sightings were recorded last year in places as far afield as Peterborough in Cambridgeshire (\"four dull red lights\"), Paignton in Devon (\"long single black cylinder\") and Honley in West Yorkshire (\"looked like a jellyfish flying in the sky \"). Last September was a busy month for UFOs, with a \"silver disc\" in Glossop, Derbyshire; a \"bright light at first then looked like a box kite\" in Barry, South Wales; \"two silvery objects pulling apart and moving together\" in Holywell, Flintshire; and \"a great bright light like a big ball of fire\" over Iwerne Minster in Somerset. The area with the most frequent mysterious activity has been West Kilbride, on the southwest coast of Scotland. The MoD received a dozen reports during the year of increasingly dramatic visitations, from \"one sphere\" on April 2, \"five bright spheres\" on May 30 to \"at least 25 yellow spheres flying in groups of five\" on November 26. None of them would have passed the stringent examination of the Flying Saucer Working Party, however, which was quick to dismiss the flurry of reports in 1950 which followed early publicity surrounding an original \"flying saucer\" in the United States in 1947. Although the group praised a \"careful and accurate\" observation by a locomotive fireman of a luminous body travelling at high speed over Derby, it was \"undoubtedly a meteorite\". The evidence of a Flight Lieutenant Hubbard, an experienced pilot, was also discounted in trenchant terms. Hubbard reported \"a flat disc, light pearl grey in colour... executing a series of S-turns and oscillating\". But the working party concluded: \"We conclude that Flight Lieutenant Hubbard was the victim of an optical illusion or that he observed some quite normal type of aircraft and deceived himself about its shape and speed.\" Britain=92s UFO spotters are as unimpressed with the Government=92s disclosures as officials were then with Flight Lieutenant Hubbard. Judith Jafar, the chair of the British UFO Research Association, said: \"It is a pointless exercise because the Government is not going to release any files that are contentious in any way. The files they are releasing now are not going to take us anywhere that we have not been before.\" However, in a letter accompanying the release of the report, the MoD states: \"The MoD does not have any expertise or role in respect of UFO/flying saucer matters or to the question of the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial lifeforms, about which it remains totally open-minded.\"", "label": "clean"}

Whether it’s at a party or at lunch, on Twitter or in comments on news articles or on blog posts, there’s this anger at doctors. Doctors do their jobs poorly, doctors are trained “wrong” from the get-go, doctors should simply be replaced by nurses because nurses do the same thing and they do it for less money, doctors have the American Medical Association (AMA) which is a monopoly and is at the root of so many of our problems in healthcare, and so on. As you may have also noticed, I’m pro-doctor. I think there’s a lot of misplaced anger and a lot of misunderstanding about how the system works. Even so, I decided it was time to pick at some of these knots. If we’re going to rebuild the healthcare system - and we should - we have to address this issue.

Likewise, food allergies can also alter brain function and trigger depression (Biol Psychiatry, 1981; 16: 3-19). Wheat, milk, corn, beef and eggs are common culprits (Ann Allergy, 1982; 48: 166-71). But bear in mind that food allergies linked to depression often have an addictive quality - so whatever you eat compulsively may be contributing to the problem.", "label": "clean"}

There were reports that UNITA engaged in reprisal attacks on civilians during the year. UNITA reportedly cut off the ears and hands of civilians in order to extract information and to discourage civilians from providing the Government information on UNITA or from fleeing to government-controlled areas. UNITA increased attacks against population centers and other civilian targets during the year as part of a strategy that likely was designed to create insecurity and international attention, which resulted in the injuries of numerous civilians (see Section 1.a.).", "label": "clean"}

In exchange for those bribes, Travis and Vulpis directed trades, and the resulting commissions, to those broker-dealers paying the bribes. Travis and Vulpis did not disclose these bribes or the material conflict of interest that they created to the investment advisor, defrauding the hedge funds that JLF advised.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Interactive fiction has excited huge interest amongst scholars and experimental artists since the pioneering work of Michael Joyce in the 1980s. However, it has not reached out to a wide community of writers and readers, largely because of the twin problems of poor reader engagement with fractured narrative structures, and the heavy cognitive demands of the interfaces used by hyper-writers. This article reports upon an empirical study of readers’ responses to a range of interactive fictions, a study which aimed to uncover in detail the key factors affecting readers’ experience of this narrative form. On the basis of the study’s findings, it is argued that interactive fiction can offer an enjoyable reading experience, if core issues around narrative structure and interface design are addressed by writers. The article suggests guidelines for writers, based on the findings of the empirical study.", "label": "clean"}

{"text": "Other people experience some \"unstressing\" or \"headache\" difficulties from even the basic \"twenty minutes twice a day\" practice. In such cases the TM checkers and teachers will encourage them to continue with the TM practice even though they should really quit because they are experiencing toxic side-effects. However, I don't know that anyone who has completely limited themselves to \"twenty minutes twice a day\" has ever had dramatic psychological damage as a result. Still, these \"unstressing\" symptoms indicate that they shouldn't really be continuing the practice, and they probably wouldn't continue in the face of such difficulties if TM personnel didn't talk them out of quitting. As with the prior group, I believe that these people are susceptible to TM trance induction techniques but have not proven susceptible to TM dogmatic indoctrination. However, these people have proven sensitive to even the amount of trance, dissociation, and toxic suggestion that even the basic \"twenty minutes twice a day\" brings. Hopefully they will stop paying attention to the TM checkers and teachers and will quit the practice of TM entirely.", "label": "clean"}

The peak seasons can be extra difficult if you have a family since working overtime and being on call at all hours (including weekends) can mean you're not able to spend as much quality time with those you care about.

{"text": "I'm not surprised you've been shocked by some of the comments left. I've been pretty shocked too.The thing that is the most shocking to me is that people are posting the most horrific stories of flagrant abuse by TSO's like patients with a medical need, babies and small children being denied water and food! A basic, human right and yet the TSA is confiscating baby food, telling parents just how much food they can bring to feed their children. The TSA is abusing the elderly and the sick by forcing them to remove shoes and belts, throwing away water, confiscating needed medicines or creams and so much more. I'm shocked at how many stories there are of items so commonplace as to be ridiculous being confiscated.Please, post a video of an explosive that can be made to resemble peanut butter (down to the smell), or strawberry jam, or barbecue sauce or any of the other hundreds of thousands of items that people carry with them on a daily basis. I've seen some answers to some of the questions here, but I've yet to see anyone address the liquids ban convincingly. If it looks like peanut butter and it smells like peanut butter, why is it considered a \"gel\"? It's food, not a dangerous substance! If I'm facing a 2-3 hour pre-boarding time, plus a 5-6 hour flight, yes I want to bring real food with me and so do people who are diabetic, have medical conditions, are traveling with children or have dietary restrictions for any reason. The TSA counters that you can get food behind the security check but for real, when one single banana costs $1.50 or more, a small 16 oz. bottle of water goes for $2-3 and there isn't any \"real\" food to get behind the security lines besides an expensive, greasy pile of fries or a scone from Starbuck's this is just not an option. And as countless people have pointed out, you can't find baby food or formula behind those security lines. Neither can you find healthy food, vegetarian food, halal food, kosher food, vegan food, inexpensive food, non-wheat-based food (celiac disease), low-sodium food, or any other number of representative dietary restrictions. Flying is an all-day ordeal for many, as there are very few cross-country flights which don't have at least one stop, and yet the TSA expects people not to pack food! Some of the ridiculous items I've personally had confiscated in this specific category: a brick of solid cream cheese (a gel!) a home-packed tub of chunky peanut butter (a gel!) slices of cheese (a gel! how do you slice a gel? It's a mystery!). Not to mention the countless times that I have had to throw out a half a 4 oz. bottle of expensive face cream, even though there was clearly not even close to 4 oz. left in the bottle. The most frustrating part is when you say, \"well we can't post our rules, then the \"terrists will win\"and then you get all upset with us, the traveling public, when we can't follow the rules you won't tell us about! And then, when we run into something like never stopping to consider that something as commonplace and easily identifiable as peanut butter will get taken away, because we've never thought about it as a \"gel\", well we're just told to shut up and follow the rules! Then we are told we can't see a list that says something as simple as \"food items such as cheese and peanut butter fall under the \"gel\" category, so don't even try\" because the the \"terrists\" would know that peanut butter and cheese were banned substances! Follow the logic on that one for a minute!", "label": "clean"}

Shots that land on the back of the hump can easily bound into one of the bunkers behind the green, so players are often forced to putt over the ridge.", "label": "clean"}

Two weeks later we docked at Capetown and next day we were marched through the town and we had our first shore leave, revelling in the fact that there was no Black out in force, lights blazing from everywhere. We didn’t much understand, nor care for the way in which the blacks were treated. From Capetown we sailed for Durban and the Pipes and Drums played us into Durban harbour with the Highland Cradlesong, a tune that has remained one of my favourites. The ‘lady in white’ serenaded us when we docked. Apparently this lady sang to all the troop ships when they docked at Durban.", "label": "clean"}

There is the verse that say by His stripes we are healed; those stripes generally considered to be at His scourging before the Roman soldiers; suggesting more of a payment/price paid rather than a consumption. Could these healings have been paid on a promissary note? The faith of our Lord in this regard is in the prophet Isaiah, that through him (and select others) the Father had beforehand mandated the steps to be followed by the Christ.

More energy is lost as the power is moved around the electricity grid network and converted from high transmission voltage down to a supply suitable for domestic or commercial consumers. The system is innately vulnerable to disruption: localised technical, weather-related or even deliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting in widespread blackouts. Whichever technology is used to generate electricity within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitably be subject to some, or all, of these problems.

{"text": "As a matter of regulating the procedure in its own state courts, the California Supreme Court has decided that mandamus or declaratory relief rather than inverse condemnation provides \"the appropriate relief\" for one who challenges a regulation as a taking. Agins v. Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d, at 277, 598 P.2d, at 31. This statement in Agins can be interpreted in two quite different ways. First, it may merely require the property owner to exhaust his equitable remedies before asserting any claim for damages. Under that reading, a postponement of any consideration of monetary relief, or even a requirement that a \"temporary regulatory taking\" claim be asserted in a separate proceeding after the temporary interference has ended, would not violate the Federal Constitution. Second, the Agins opinion may be read to indicate that California courts will never award damages for a temporary regulatory taking. 15 Even if we assume that such a rigid rule would bar recovery in the California courts in a few meritorious cases, we should not allow a litigant to challenge the rule unless his complaint contains allegations explaining why declaratory relief would not provide him with an adequate remedy, and unless his complaint at least complies with the California rule of procedure to the extent that the rule is clearly legitimate. Since the First Amendment is not implicated, the fact that California's rule may be somewhat \"overbroad\" is no reason for permitting a party to complain about the impact of the rule on other property owners [482 U.S. 304, 338] who actually file complaints that call California's rule into question.", "label": "clean"}

Some brands like Dell and Oracle have employees that share the name of the brand @richardatdell which creates a unique hybrid brand –yet with it’s own challenges. Some brands use the corporate handle and an ‘official spokesperson’ like @marketingprofs will indicate their persona and face.

{"text": "The Gophers knew they would be challenged up front by Western Michigan's pass-heavy tendencies. Pressure on Broncos senior QB Alex Carder came and went. Carder wasn't constantly bothered as UNLV and New Hampshire's QBs were in the first two games. Carder tried to mix it up between quick passes and waiting for his receivers to get in position for the deep throw. The results varied. Carder never fully got into a rhythm - more a credit to the secondary than the D-line. DE D.L. Wilhite overtook NT Ra'Shede Hageman for the team lead in sacks by chasing Carder and bringing him to the ground to end a 10-play drive in the second quarter. The Gophers' second sack of the game came in a big situation on Western Michigan's final drive of the game, when a touchdown would have likely won it. After WMU was called for an illegal formation, DE Michael Amaefula followed on the next play by sacking Carder and pushing the Broncos into a second and 20. Three plays later the game was over. Kill mentioned how the team was surprised by how much Western Michigan decided to run. The Broncos tallied 38 rushing attempts - most by any \"U\" opponent this season -- for 165 yards. The D-line was lagging in rush defense as the unit was beat to the corners numerous times. The line combined for its lowest number of tackles on the year (nine) -- they recorded 15 at UNLV and 16 against New Hampshire. Amaefula, Hageman and junior Roland Johnson led the unit with two apiece - all of which were solo tackles. Wilhite, freshman Scott Ekpe and redshirt Cameron Botticelli each had one.", "label": "clean"}

We have studied the importance of root growth and N uptake to a depth of 2.5 m in fully grown field vegetables and cover crops by use of minirhizotrons and deep point placement of 15N. Deep rooted crucifereous crops were found to have high root densities to a depth of 1.5-2 m and high 15N uptake to this depth. The work shows that knowledge of the interactions between root growth and soil N below a depth of 1 m are important to understand crop N uptake and nitrate leaching from agro-ecosystems.", "label": "clean"}
